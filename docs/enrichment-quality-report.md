   - Re-run enrichment if quality is below threshold

---

### Process Improvements

1. **Automated JSON Validation**
   ```typescript
   // Add to enrichment pipeline
   function validateAndSaveJSON(data: any, filepath: string) {
     const jsonString = JSON.stringify(data, null, 2);
     JSON.parse(jsonString); // Throws if invalid
     writeFileSync(filepath, jsonString);
   }
   ```

2. **Pre-Save Quality Checks**
   - Implement minimum length validators
   - Check for required fields before saving
   - Validate confidence scores are in range

3. **Batch Monitoring**
   - Run quality checks every 10 batches during enrichment
   - Alert on quality scores below 80
   - Implement automatic retry for low-confidence wines

---

### Future Enhancements

1. **Duplicate Detection**
   - Implement fuzzy matching to detect similar tasting notes
   - Flag wines with >80% similarity for review
   - Ensure each wine has truly unique descriptions

2. **Language Quality Scoring**
   - Implement readability metrics (Flesch-Kincaid)
   - Check for professional wine vocabulary usage
   - Validate descriptor variety and specificity

3. **Data Enrichment Expansion**
   - Add producer information and history
