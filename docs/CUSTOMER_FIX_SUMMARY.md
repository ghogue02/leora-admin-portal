# Customer Display Fix - Quick Summary

## Problem
Travis Vernon saw "No customers found" despite 4,838 customers existing in database.

## Root Cause
All customers had `salesRepId = NULL`, and the API only shows customers assigned to the logged-in sales rep.

## Solution
1. **Ran assignment script** - Distributed 4,838 customers across 6 sales reps based on territory
2. **Added flexibility** - Created "My Customers" vs "All Customers" toggle

## Results
✅ Travis now sees **1,907 customers** (South Territory - VA)
✅ Toggle allows viewing all 4,838 customers when needed
✅ All features (filtering, search, pagination) work correctly

## Quick Commands

### Run Assignment Fix
```bash
cd /Users/greghogue/Leora2/web
npx tsx scripts/assign-customers.ts
```

### Verify Assignments
```bash
npx tsx scripts/verify-assignments.ts
```

## Distribution
- **North Territory** (Kelly): 1,202 customers
- **South Territory** (Travis): 1,907 customers ← Fixed!
- **East Territory** (Carolyn): 538 customers
- **Virginia Territory** (Admin): 397 customers
- **NYC** (Greg): 397 customers
- **All Territories** (Test): 397 customers

## Prevention
- Run `npm run db:seed` to assign customers during seeding
- Use assignment script when importing new customer data
- Monitor for unassigned customers with health checks
