## Photography Best Practices

### Lighting Conditions

#### Ideal Lighting

**Natural Light (Best):**
- Near window
- Indirect sunlight
- Cloudy day (diffused light)
- 10 AM - 2 PM
- No direct sun on card

**Indoor Lighting (Good):**
- Bright overhead lights
- LED desk lamp
- Multiple light sources
- Avoid single harsh light

**Supplemental Light:**
- Use phone flashlight for dark areas
- Bounce light off wall/ceiling
- Use white paper as reflector

#### Avoid

- Direct sunlight (causes glare)
- Single point light (harsh shadows)
- Backlighting (card appears dark)
- Mixed color temperatures
- Fluorescent flicker

### Camera Settings

#### Recommended Settings

**iOS Camera:**
1. Disable Live Photos (saves space)
2. Enable HDR for high contrast
3. Use grid lines for alignment
4. Tap to focus on text
5. Exposure: Auto

**Android Camera:**
1. HDR: On
2. Scene optimizer: On
3. Focus mode: Auto
4. Grid: On (if available)
5. Flash: Off (unless very dark)

#### Resolution

- **Minimum**: 2MP (1600x1200)
- **Recommended**: 8MP+ (3264x2448)
- **Maximum**: No limit (auto-compressed)

Higher resolution = better OCR accuracy

### Common Photography Issues

#### Blurry Photos

**Causes:**

**Solutions:**
- Move to brighter area
- Adjust exposure (+1 or +2)
- Use flashlight/lamp
- Remove shadow source

#### Glare/Reflections

**Causes:**
- Glossy/laminated cards
- Direct light source

**Solutions:**
- Adjust angle slightly
- Diffuse light source
- Disable flash

#### Distorted Perspective

**Causes:**
- Camera angle too steep
- Card tilted
- Wide-angle lens distortion

**Solutions:**

## Advanced Techniques

### Professional Results

#### Setup

1. **Surface:**
   - Use matte/non-reflective surface
   - White or neutral background

2. **Lighting:**
   - Two light sources at 45° angles
   - Equal intensity
   - 12-18 inches from card
   - Diffused (not direct)

3. **Camera:**
   - Rear camera (better quality)
   - 8-12 inches above card
   - Perpendicular to surface
   - Grid lines enabled

#### Batch Scanning

For multiple cards:

1. Stack cards next to workspace

3. Set aside in "scanned" pile
4. Scan next card
5. Repeat until done
6. Review all extractions at end

**Speed Tips:**
- Keep setup constant
- Use same lighting
- Develop rhythm
- Don't review each immediately
- Batch review all at once

### Difficult Cards

#### Dark Cards

- Increase exposure (+2)
- Use additional lighting
- Slow shutter (hold very steady)
- Edit brightness after capture

#### Embossed/Textured

- Side lighting to enhance texture
- Capture at slight angle (5-10°)
- Multiple shots from different angles
- AI may need manual help

#### Unusual Sizes

**Oversized:**
- Capture in sections
- Upload multiple images
- Merge data manually

**Small (Mini Cards):**
- Use macro mode if available
- Get closer (6 inches)
- Ensure focus sharp
- May need to crop

#### Handwritten Information

- Best lighting critical
- Highest resolution
- Very sharp focus
- May require manual entry
- AI accuracy lower (~60%)
