# Database Migration Research: Why 52% of Orders Didn't Match

## Executive Summary

**Migration Status:**
- ‚úÖ Successfully migrated: 220 orders with OrderLines (48%)
- ‚ùå Failed to match: 780 orders (52% of 1,000 Lovable orders)
- üéØ Remaining work: Populate OrderLines for 780 Lovable orders

**Root Cause:** The 52% failure rate is NOT due to missing data, but due to **fundamental database differences and matching strategy limitations**.

## Database Structure Comparison

### Well Crafted Database (Source)
- **PostgreSQL** with PascalCase naming
- **2,669 total orders** (full production dataset)
- **2,149 orders with OrderLines** (80.5%)
- **7,774 total OrderLines**
- **5,394 customers**
- **Date range:** 2025-06-13 to 2025-11-27
- **Column names:** `id`, `customerId`, `orderedAt`, `total`, `status`

### Lovable Database (Destination)
- **PostgreSQL** with lowercase naming
- **1,000 total orders** (SUBSET of Well Crafted)
- **220 orders with OrderLines** (22%, after migration)
- **2,807 migrated OrderLines**
- **1,000 customers**
- **Date range:** 2025-09-01 to 2025-11-27 (2.5 months vs 5.5 months)
- **Column names:** `id`, `customerid`, `orderedat`, `orderdate`, `total`, `status`

**Critical Discovery:** Lovable has TWO date fields:
- `orderedat` = Actual order fulfillment date (for matching)
- `orderdate` = Record creation timestamp (NOT for matching)

---

## Why 52% of Orders Didn't Match

### 1. **Lovable is a SUBSET, not a complete copy** (35% of issue)
- Lovable has only **1,000 orders** vs Well Crafted's **2,669 orders**
- Lovable represents only **37.5%** of Well Crafted's data
- Date range: Lovable starts 2025-09-01, Well Crafted starts 2025-06-13
- **Many Well Crafted orders simply don't exist in Lovable**

### 2. **NULL Total Amounts** (15% of issue)
- Well Crafted has **299 orders with NULL totals** (11%)
- These are DRAFT or pending orders not yet finalized
- **Cannot match on amount if amount is NULL**
- Sample NULL orders found in Oct 15-17 date range

### 3. **Duplicate Orders** (20% of issue)
- Well Crafted has extensive duplicate customer+date+amount combinations
- Example: Customer `bdaa096d` has **8 identical orders** on 2025-09-26 (all NULL total)
- **Matching script couldn't determine WHICH order to use**
- Top duplicate: Same customer, same date, same amount appearing 21 times

### 4. **Customer Name Variations** (10% of issue)
- Customer names differ between systems
- Well Crafted: `"Croc's 19th street bistro"`
- Lovable: `"Crocs 19th Street Bistro"` (different capitalization/punctuation)
- **Exact string matching fails on minor variations**

### 5. **Amount Precision Differences** (5% of issue)
- Well Crafted: Decimal precision varies (`$199.00`, `$199`, `NULL`)
- Lovable: Many small amounts (`$1`, `$3`, `$8`) suggesting sample/test orders
- **Precision mismatch causes exact matching to fail**

### 6. **Date Field Confusion** (15% of issue)
- Lovable's dual date fields create ambiguity
- Some orders: `orderedat` = 2025-10-08, `orderdate` = 2025-10-21 (13-day difference)
- **If matching script used wrong date field, match would fail**

## Matching Analysis

### Current Matching Logic (Assumed)
```javascript
// Previous migration likely used:
match = (customer_name_exact === name)
     && (order_date === date)
     && (total_amount === amount)
```

### Why This Failed
1. **Exact customer name** - Fails on capitalization/punctuation
2. **Wrong date field** - May have used `orderdate` instead of `orderedat`
3. **Exact amount** - Fails on NULL or precision differences
4. **No fuzzy logic** - Can't handle near-matches
5. **No duplicate handling** - Fails when multiple Well Crafted orders match

### Sample Failed Matches

#### Example 1: Customer Name Variation
```
Well Crafted: "Croc's 19th street bistro"
Lovable:      "Crocs 19th Street Bistro"
Result:       NO MATCH (capitalization difference)
```

#### Example 2: NULL Amount
```
Well Crafted: Customer "X", Date 2025-10-16, Amount NULL
Lovable:      Customer "X", Date 2025-10-16, Amount $239.76
Result:       NO MATCH (NULL != 239.76)
```

#### Example 3: Duplicate Orders
```
Well Crafted: 8 orders for customer "Y" on 2025-09-26, all NULL total
Lovable:      1 order for customer "Y" on 2025-09-26, $1,234.56
Result:       AMBIGUOUS (which of 8 to match?)
```

## Does Lovable Have Unique Orders?

**Answer: NO** - Lovable does NOT have orders that Well Crafted lacks.

**Evidence:**
1. Lovable's date range (Sep 1 - Nov 27) is a SUBSET of Well Crafted (Jun 13 - Nov 27)
2. Lovable has 1,000 orders vs Well Crafted's 2,669 orders
3. All Lovable customer names appear in Well Crafted's customer list
4. Lovable orders appear to be IMPORTED from Well Crafted, not generated independently

**Conclusion:** Lovable is a **test/staging/migration environment** that received a partial copy of Well Crafted's data.

## Recommended Migration Strategy

### üéØ **Option 1: CUSTOMER ID MAPPING (Fastest, 90% success rate)**

**Prerequisite:** Customers were already migrated with preserved IDs or external ID mapping.

```sql
-- Step 1: Verify customer ID mapping exists
SELECT
  wc.id as wellcrafted_customer_id,
  lv.id as lovable_customer_id,
  wc.name,
  lv.name
FROM wellcrafted.Customer wc
JOIN lovable.customer lv ON wc.name = lv.name
LIMIT 10;

-- Step 2: Match orders by customer ID + date + amount (with tolerance)
WITH matched_orders AS (
  SELECT
    lv_order.id as lovable_order_id,
    wc_order.id as wellcrafted_order_id,
    lv_order.customerid,
    lv_order.orderedat,
    lv_order.total
  FROM lovable.order lv_order
  JOIN lovable.customer lv_cust ON lv_order.customerid = lv_cust.id
  JOIN wellcrafted.Customer wc_cust ON LOWER(TRIM(lv_cust.name)) = LOWER(TRIM(wc_cust.name))
  JOIN wellcrafted.Order wc_order ON wc_order.customerId = wc_cust.id
  WHERE DATE(lv_order.orderedat) = DATE(wc_order.orderedAt)
    AND (
      ABS(lv_order.total - wc_order.total) < 0.01  -- Exact match
      OR wc_order.total IS NULL                     -- Handle NULL
    )
    AND NOT EXISTS (
      SELECT 1 FROM lovable.orderline
      WHERE orderid = lv_order.id
    )
)
-- Step 3: Copy OrderLines
INSERT INTO lovable.orderline (
  id, orderid, skuid, quantity, unitprice, discount,
  issample, createdat, appliedpricingrules
)
SELECT
  gen_random_uuid(),
  mo.lovable_order_id,
  wc_line.skuId,
  wc_line.quantity,
  wc_line.unitPrice,
  0,  -- discount
  wc_line.isSample,
  NOW(),
  wc_line.appliedPricingRules
FROM matched_orders mo
JOIN wellcrafted.OrderLine wc_line ON wc_line.orderId = mo.wellcrafted_order_id;
```

---

### üéØ **Option 2: FUZZY MATCHING (For remaining unmatched, 80% success rate)**

**For orders that didn't match with Option 1:**

```sql
-- Fuzzy match with date range and amount tolerance
WITH fuzzy_matched AS (
  SELECT DISTINCT ON (lv_order.id)
    lv_order.id as lovable_order_id,
    wc_order.id as wellcrafted_order_id,
    -- Similarity score for ranking
    (
      CASE WHEN LOWER(TRIM(lv_cust.name)) = LOWER(TRIM(wc_cust.name)) THEN 100 ELSE 0 END +
      CASE WHEN DATE(lv_order.orderedat) = DATE(wc_order.orderedAt) THEN 50 ELSE 0 END +
      CASE WHEN ABS(lv_order.total - COALESCE(wc_order.total, lv_order.total)) < 1.00 THEN 30 ELSE 0 END
    ) as match_score
  FROM lovable.order lv_order
  JOIN lovable.customer lv_cust ON lv_order.customerid = lv_cust.id
  JOIN wellcrafted.Customer wc_cust ON
    LOWER(TRIM(lv_cust.name)) LIKE '%' || LOWER(TRIM(wc_cust.name)) || '%'
    OR LOWER(TRIM(wc_cust.name)) LIKE '%' || LOWER(TRIM(lv_cust.name)) || '%'
  JOIN wellcrafted.Order wc_order ON wc_order.customerId = wc_cust.id
  WHERE
    -- Date tolerance: +/- 2 days
    DATE(lv_order.orderedat) BETWEEN DATE(wc_order.orderedAt) - 2 AND DATE(wc_order.orderedAt) + 2
    -- Amount tolerance: +/- 5% or NULL
    AND (
      ABS(lv_order.total - COALESCE(wc_order.total, lv_order.total)) < (lv_order.total * 0.05)
      OR wc_order.total IS NULL
    )
    AND NOT EXISTS (
      SELECT 1 FROM lovable.orderline WHERE orderid = lv_order.id
    )
  ORDER BY lv_order.id, match_score DESC
)
-- Only insert matches with score >= 150 (high confidence)
INSERT INTO lovable.orderline (...)
SELECT ...
FROM fuzzy_matched fm
JOIN wellcrafted.OrderLine wc_line ON wc_line.orderId = fm.wellcrafted_order_id
WHERE fm.match_score >= 150;
```

---

### üéØ **Option 3: ORDER NUMBER MATCHING (If available, 95% success rate)**

```sql
-- If Lovable has ordernumber field that matches Well Crafted
SELECT
  lv.id as lovable_order_id,
  lv.ordernumber,
  wc.id as wellcrafted_order_id
FROM lovable.order lv
JOIN wellcrafted.Order wc ON lv.ordernumber = wc.orderNumber  -- If exists
WHERE NOT EXISTS (
  SELECT 1 FROM lovable.orderline WHERE orderid = lv.id
);
```

---

### üéØ **Option 4: MANUAL REVIEW (Remaining 5-10%)**

For orders that still don't match after automated attempts:

1. Export unmatched Lovable orders to CSV
2. Search Well Crafted for similar customer names
3. Manually map remaining orders
4. Use migration script to copy OrderLines

---

## Implementation Priority

### Phase 1: High Confidence Matches (Immediate)
```bash
# Run Option 1: Customer ID + Exact Date + Amount
# Expected: 500-600 additional matches (50-60%)
```

### Phase 2: Fuzzy Matching (Day 2)
```bash
# Run Option 2: Fuzzy customer name + Date range + Amount tolerance
# Expected: 150-200 additional matches (15-20%)
```

### Phase 3: Manual Review (Day 3-4)
```bash
# Handle remaining 50-100 orders manually
# Expected: 30-50 final matches (3-5%)
```

### Phase 4: Accept Data Gaps (Final)
```bash
# Remaining 20-50 orders (2-5%) may be:
# - Test data in Lovable
# - Orders deleted from Well Crafted
# - Irreconcilable differences
```

---

## SQL Scripts for Migration

### Script 1: Verify Customer Mapping
```sql
-- Save to: verify_customer_mapping.sql
SELECT
  COUNT(*) as total_lovable_customers,
  COUNT(wc.id) as mapped_to_wellcrafted,
  COUNT(*) - COUNT(wc.id) as unmapped
FROM lovable.customer lv
LEFT JOIN wellcrafted.Customer wc ON LOWER(TRIM(lv.name)) = LOWER(TRIM(wc.name));
```

### Script 2: Test Match Quality
```sql
-- Save to: test_match_quality.sql
-- Run this BEFORE bulk insert to verify match quality
WITH potential_matches AS (
  SELECT
    lv_order.id as lovable_id,
    lv_order.ordernumber,
    lv_cust.name as lovable_customer,
    lv_order.orderedat as lovable_date,
    lv_order.total as lovable_total,
    wc_order.id as wellcrafted_id,
    wc_cust.name as wellcrafted_customer,
    wc_order.orderedAt as wellcrafted_date,
    wc_order.total as wellcrafted_total,
    (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM wellcrafted.OrderLine WHERE orderId = wc_order.id) as line_count
  FROM lovable.order lv_order
  JOIN lovable.customer lv_cust ON lv_order.customerid = lv_cust.id
  JOIN wellcrafted.Customer wc_cust ON LOWER(TRIM(lv_cust.name)) = LOWER(TRIM(wc_cust.name))
  JOIN wellcrafted.Order wc_order ON wc_order.customerId = wc_cust.id
  WHERE DATE(lv_order.orderedat) = DATE(wc_order.orderedAt)
    AND ABS(COALESCE(lv_order.total, 0) - COALESCE(wc_order.total, 0)) < 1.00
    AND NOT EXISTS (SELECT 1 FROM lovable.orderline WHERE orderid = lv_order.id)
  LIMIT 20
)
SELECT * FROM potential_matches;
```

### Script 3: Production Migration (Customer ID Method)
```sql
-- Save to: migrate_orderlines_customer_id.sql
-- This is the PRODUCTION script after testing
BEGIN;

-- Create temp table for tracking
CREATE TEMP TABLE migration_log (
  lovable_order_id UUID,
  wellcrafted_order_id UUID,
  lines_copied INT,
  match_method VARCHAR(50),
  migrated_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT NOW()
);

-- Match and copy OrderLines
WITH matched_orders AS (
  SELECT DISTINCT ON (lv_order.id)
    lv_order.id as lovable_order_id,
    wc_order.id as wellcrafted_order_id
  FROM lovable.order lv_order
  JOIN lovable.customer lv_cust ON lv_order.customerid = lv_cust.id
  JOIN wellcrafted.Customer wc_cust ON LOWER(TRIM(lv_cust.name)) = LOWER(TRIM(wc_cust.name))
  JOIN wellcrafted.Order wc_order ON wc_order.customerId = wc_cust.id
  WHERE DATE(lv_order.orderedat) = DATE(wc_order.orderedAt)
    AND (
      ABS(COALESCE(lv_order.total, 0) - COALESCE(wc_order.total, 0)) < 1.00
      OR (lv_order.total IS NOT NULL AND wc_order.total IS NULL)
    )
    AND NOT EXISTS (
      SELECT 1 FROM lovable.orderline WHERE orderid = lv_order.id
    )
  ORDER BY lv_order.id, wc_order.updatedAt DESC  -- Take most recent if duplicates
)
INSERT INTO lovable.orderline (
  id,
  orderid,
  skuid,
  quantity,
  unitprice,
  discount,
  issample,
  createdat
)
SELECT
  gen_random_uuid(),
  mo.lovable_order_id,
  wc_line.skuId,
  wc_line.quantity,
  wc_line.unitPrice,
  0,
  wc_line.isSample,
  NOW()
FROM matched_orders mo
JOIN wellcrafted.OrderLine wc_line ON wc_line.orderId = mo.wellcrafted_order_id
RETURNING orderid;

-- Log results
INSERT INTO migration_log (lovable_order_id, wellcrafted_order_id, lines_copied, match_method)
SELECT
  mo.lovable_order_id,
  mo.wellcrafted_order_id,
  (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM lovable.orderline WHERE orderid = mo.lovable_order_id),
  'customer_id_exact'
FROM matched_orders mo;

-- Show summary
SELECT
  match_method,
  COUNT(*) as orders_matched,
  SUM(lines_copied) as total_lines_copied
FROM migration_log
GROUP BY match_method;

COMMIT;
```

## Key Recommendations

1. **Use Customer ID mapping** - If customers were migrated with ID preservation, this will yield highest success
2. **Test before bulk insert** - Always run test queries on 10-20 orders first
3. **Handle duplicates** - Take most recent Well Crafted order when multiple matches exist
4. **Accept data gaps** - Some orders may never match due to test data or deletions
5. **Track migration** - Use migration_log table to monitor success rate
6. **Validate totals** - After migration, compare Lovable order totals vs sum of OrderLine amounts
