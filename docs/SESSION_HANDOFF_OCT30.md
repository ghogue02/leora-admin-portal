# Session Handoff - October 30, 2025
## VA Invoice System Implementation - Ready for Local Testing

---

## 🎯 Current Status: PRODUCTION IS WORKING

**Production URL**: https://web-omega-five-81.vercel.app
**Status**: ✅ Stable and working (rolled back)
**Login Credentials**: travis@wellcraftedbeverage.com / SalesDemo2025!

**Local Dev**: http://localhost:3000 (may need to restart with `npm run dev`)

---

## 📊 What Was Completed Today

### ✅ Completed & Working (In Production):
1. **Security Incident Resolved**
   - GitGuardian password exposure fixed
   - Git history cleaned
   - Jared's new password: `SecureTempmdxnfq9b!@#` (send securely!)

2. **Sales Rep Assignment Complete**
   - Jared Lorenz created as 7th field rep
   - 127 NWVA customers assigned to Jared
   - 3,901 house accounts consolidated to Travis Vernon
   - ZERO null assignments (100% coverage)

### ✅ Completed But Not Yet in Production (Saved in Branch):
**Branch**: `feature/va-invoices-work-in-progress`

**VA ABC Invoice System** (All 5 phases complete):
- Phase 1: Database schema (20 fields, 2 tables, 1 enum)
- Phase 2: Business logic (6 services, 57 tests passing)
- Phase 3: PDF templates (3 formats: In-State, Tax-Exempt, Standard)
- Phase 4: UI components (format selector, PDF preview, download)
- Phase 5: Testing & documentation

**Total Code**: ~6,000 lines across 35 files

---

## ❌ Why It's Not in Production

**Problem**: When I added sales rep invoice creation capabilities, I introduced a critical bug:
- File: `src/app/api/sales/orders/[id]/create-invoice/route.ts`
- Issue: Imported non-existent function `getServerSession`
- Impact: Crashed all `/api/sales/*` routes including login
- Result: Login timed out, entire sales portal unusable

**Solution Attempted**: 6 different fixes, none worked due to cascading issues

**Decision**: Rollback to working version, re-implement incrementally with local testing

---

## 🔧 Next Session: Re-Implementation Plan

### Files Location

**All completed work is in**: `feature/va-invoices-work-in-progress` branch

**To see what was built**:
```bash
git log feature/va-invoices-work-in-progress --oneline
git show feature/va-invoices-work-in-progress:path/to/file
```

---

### Step-by-Step Re-Implementation Guide

#### **STEP 1: Database Schema** (20 minutes)

**What to do**:
1. Copy schema changes from feature branch:
   ```bash
   git show feature/va-invoices-work-in-progress:prisma/schema.prisma > /tmp/new-schema.prisma
   ```

2. Manually merge the new fields into current `prisma/schema.prisma`:
   - Add `InvoiceFormatType` enum
   - Add 11 fields to Invoice model
   - Add 2 fields to OrderLine model
   - Add 1 field to SKU model
   - Add 2 fields to Customer model
   - Add 2 fields to Tenant model
   - Add InvoiceTemplate table
   - Add TaxRule table

3. Test locally:
   ```bash
   npx prisma db push
   npx prisma generate
   npm run dev
   ```

4. **CRITICAL**: Test login at http://localhost:3000/sales/login
   - If login works → proceed to Step 2
   - If login breaks → revert schema changes

---

#### **STEP 2: Business Logic** (30 minutes)

**What to copy**:
```bash
# Copy entire invoices library
git show feature/va-invoices-work-in-progress:src/lib/invoices/format-selector.ts > src/lib/invoices/format-selector.ts
git show feature/va-invoices-work-in-progress:src/lib/invoices/tax-calculator.ts > src/lib/invoices/tax-calculator.ts
git show feature/va-invoices-work-in-progress:src/lib/invoices/liter-calculator.ts > src/lib/invoices/liter-calculator.ts
git show feature/va-invoices-work-in-progress:src/lib/invoices/case-converter.ts > src/lib/invoices/case-converter.ts
git show feature/va-invoices-work-in-progress:src/lib/invoices/interest-calculator.ts > src/lib/invoices/interest-calculator.ts
git show feature/va-invoices-work-in-progress:src/lib/invoices/invoice-data-builder.ts > src/lib/invoices/invoice-data-builder.ts
git show feature/va-invoices-work-in-progress:src/lib/invoices/index.ts > src/lib/invoices/index.ts

# Copy tests
mkdir -p src/lib/invoices/__tests__
git show feature/va-invoices-work-in-progress:src/lib/invoices/__tests__/format-selector.test.ts > src/lib/invoices/__tests__/format-selector.test.ts
# ... (4 test files total)
```

**Test**:
```bash
npm test -- src/lib/invoices
# Should show: 57/57 tests passing

npm run dev
# Test login still works
```

---

#### **STEP 3: PDF Templates** (30 minutes)

**What to copy**:
```bash
mkdir -p src/lib/invoices/templates
git show feature/va-invoices-work-in-progress:src/lib/invoices/templates/styles.ts > src/lib/invoices/templates/styles.ts
git show feature/va-invoices-work-in-progress:src/lib/invoices/templates/va-abc-instate.tsx > src/lib/invoices/templates/va-abc-instate.tsx
git show feature/va-invoices-work-in-progress:src/lib/invoices/templates/va-abc-tax-exempt.tsx > src/lib/invoices/templates/va-abc-tax-exempt.tsx
git show feature/va-invoices-work-in-progress:src/lib/invoices/templates/standard.tsx > src/lib/invoices/templates/standard.tsx
git show feature/va-invoices-work-in-progress:src/lib/invoices/templates/index.tsx > src/lib/invoices/templates/index.tsx
```

**Copy PDF API**:
```bash
mkdir -p src/app/api/invoices/[id]/pdf
git show feature/va-invoices-work-in-progress:src/app/api/invoices/[id]/pdf/route.ts > src/app/api/invoices/[id]/pdf/route.ts
```

**Test**:
```bash
npm run build
# Should succeed

npm run dev
# Test login still works
# Try to access: http://localhost:3000/api/invoices/test-id/pdf (should get 404 or 500, not timeout)
```

---

#### **STEP 4: Admin Invoice Integration ONLY** (30 minutes)

**⚠️ SKIP Sales Rep Features** - These caused the crash

**Only integrate for Admin**:

1. Copy UI components:
   ```bash
   mkdir -p src/components/invoices
   git show feature/va-invoices-work-in-progress:src/components/invoices/CreateInvoiceDialog.tsx > src/components/invoices/CreateInvoiceDialog.tsx
   git show feature/va-invoices-work-in-progress:src/components/invoices/InvoiceDownloadButton.tsx > src/components/invoices/InvoiceDownloadButton.tsx
   git show feature/va-invoices-work-in-progress:src/components/invoices/InvoicePDFPreview.tsx > src/components/invoices/InvoicePDFPreview.tsx
   git show feature/va-invoices-work-in-progress:src/components/invoices/InvoiceFormatSelector.tsx > src/components/invoices/InvoiceFormatSelector.tsx
   ```

2. **Modify CreateInvoiceDialog**:
   - Remove the `apiRoute` prop (always use admin)
   - Hardcode to `/api/sales/admin/orders/[id]/create-invoice`

3. Update admin order page:
   ```bash
   # Manually add CreateInvoiceDialog integration to:
   # src/app/admin/orders/[id]/page.tsx
   # (Same changes as before but ONLY for admin, not sales reps)
   ```

4. **DO NOT CREATE**:
   - ❌ `src/app/api/sales/orders/[id]/create-invoice/route.ts` (this broke login!)
   - ❌ `src/app/sales/orders/[id]/page.tsx` (sales rep order detail)
   - Keep these features for later after we understand the root cause

**Test**:
```bash
npm run dev
# Test admin login
# Test creating invoice from admin order
# Test PDF download
# Test login still works
```

---

#### **STEP 5: Deploy to Production** (If all tests pass)

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "feat: Re-implement VA ABC invoice system (admin only, tested locally)"
git push origin main
```

Monitor deployment, test on production.

---

## 🚨 Critical Rules for Next Session

### **Before ANY commit**:
1. ✅ Test locally first
2. ✅ Verify login works at http://localhost:3000/sales/login
3. ✅ Run `npm run build` successfully
4. ✅ Check for import errors

### **DO NOT**:
- ❌ Create `/api/sales/orders/[id]/create-invoice/route.ts` until we understand why it broke
- ❌ Use `getServerSession` - it doesn't exist
- ❌ Import from `@/lib/auth/session` in sales routes
- ❌ Deploy without local testing

### **DO**:
- ✅ Use `withSalesSession` for sales routes
- ✅ Use `withAdminSession` for admin routes
- ✅ Test login after every change
- ✅ Commit small incremental changes

## 📁 Key Files & Locations

### **Feature Branch with Completed Work**:
```
feature/va-invoices-work-in-progress
```

### **Files to Review/Copy**:

**Business Logic** (Working, safe to copy):
- `src/lib/invoices/*.ts` (6 files)
- `src/lib/invoices/__tests__/*.ts` (4 files)

**PDF Templates** (Working, safe to copy):
- `src/lib/invoices/templates/*.tsx` (5 files)
- `src/app/api/invoices/[id]/pdf/route.ts`

**UI Components** (Working, safe to copy):
- `src/components/invoices/*.tsx` (4 files)

**⚠️ DANGEROUS - Do Not Copy Yet**:
- `src/app/api/sales/orders/[id]/create-invoice/route.ts` (BROKE LOGIN!)
- `src/app/sales/orders/[id]/page.tsx` (depends on broken route)

### **Utility Scripts** (Safe, useful):
- `scripts/populate-va-invoice-data.ts` - Populates wholesaler info, ABC codes

---

## 🔍 Root Cause Still Unknown

**Why the sales invoice route broke login**:
- The import error was fixed
- The RLS wrapper was bypassed
- Login STILL timed out
- Needs deeper investigation

**Theories**:
1. Module loading cascade issue with dynamic imports
2. Prisma connection pool exhaustion
3. Some circular dependency we didn't catch
4. Service worker interfering (already fixed)

**Investigation for Next Session**:
- Test the broken route in isolation
- Add extensive logging
- Check Vercel function logs
- Test with minimal implementation first

---

## 📋 Quick Start for Next Session

```bash
# 1. Pull latest (if needed)
git pull origin main

# 2. Start local dev
npm run dev

# 3. Test current login works
open http://localhost:3000/sales/login

# 4. Copy Phase 1 (Database schema)
git show feature/va-invoices-work-in-progress:prisma/schema.prisma > /tmp/schema.txt
# Manually merge changes

# 5. Test schema changes
npx prisma db push
npx prisma generate
npm run dev
# Test login still works

# 6. Continue with Phases 2-4 as outlined above
```

## 📝 Key Learnings from Today

### What Worked Well:
1. ✅ Incremental phase approach (1→2→3→4→5)
2. ✅ Comprehensive testing (57 tests)
3. ✅ Good documentation throughout
4. ✅ Feature branch preserved all work

### What Went Wrong:
1. ❌ Deployed without thorough local testing
2. ❌ Added too many features at once
3. ❌ Import error cascaded to break everything
4. ❌ Took 6 fix attempts before rollback

### How to Avoid Next Time:
1. ✅ Always test locally first
2. ✅ Deploy one feature at a time
3. ✅ Test login after every change
4. ✅ Keep admin and sales rep features separate
5. ✅ Have rollback plan ready

---

## 🚀 Recommended Approach for Next Session

### Conservative Approach (Recommended):
1. Re-implement **admin-only** invoice features
2. Test thoroughly
3. Deploy to production
4. Get Travis approval
5. **THEN** add sales rep features in separate session

### Aggressive Approach:
1. Re-implement everything at once
2. Risk breaking login again
3. Not recommended given today's experience

## 📊 VA Invoice System - Technical Spec Summary

### What It Does:
- Automatically detects invoice format based on customer state
- VA → VA customer = In-State format (excise tax applied)
- VA → Out-of-state = Tax-Exempt format (no excise tax)
- Generates professional PDF invoices
- Calculates liters, cases, taxes automatically
- Full VA ABC compliance

### Required Data (Already Populated):
- ✅ Wholesaler license: 013293496
- ✅ Wholesaler phone: 571-359-6227
- ✅ 269 SKUs have ABC codes
- ✅ VA tax rules created

### How Travis Will Use It:
1. Go to Admin → Orders
2. Click order with VA customer
3. Click "Create Invoice"
4. Select format (auto-recommended)
5. Download PDF
6. Compare to sample invoices for approval

---

## ⚠️ Known Issues to Fix

### High Priority:
1. **Sales rep invoice creation** - Broke login, needs careful re-implementation
2. **Import pattern** - Need to establish safe import patterns for API routes

### Medium Priority:
1. **Service worker** - Aggressive caching caused issues (partially fixed)
2. **Multiple PrismaClient instances** - Should use singleton pattern

### Low Priority:
1. **UX improvements** - "Create Order" buttons (working in feature branch)
2. **Cart error messaging** - Improved in feature branch
