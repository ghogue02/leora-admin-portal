# Sample Management Guide

## Overview

Sample management is a powerful tool for wine distributors to track product samples given to customers, measure their effectiveness, and maximize return on investment. By systematically recording sample distribution and tracking conversion to orders, sales representatives can make data-driven decisions about which products to sample and which customers to target.

### Why Sample Tracking Matters

- **ROI Measurement**: Know which samples convert to orders and calculate your return on investment
- **Budget Management**: Stay within your monthly sample allowance and allocate samples strategically
- **Customer Insights**: Track customer preferences and feedback to personalize future interactions
- **Follow-up System**: Never forget to follow up on a sample tasting
- **Performance Analytics**: Identify top-performing products and sales strategies

## Quick Start: Assign Your First Sample (5 Minutes)

### Step 1: Navigate to Samples

1. Log into your sales portal
2. Click **"Sales"** in the navigation menu

## Feedback Templates

To streamline data entry, use pre-populated feedback options:

### Positive Feedback Templates

- Any special requests (pricing, delivery, etc.)
- Timing for potential orders

## Sample History

### Viewing History by Customer

From any customer detail page:

1. Navigate to the **"Sample History"** tab
2. View all samples given to this customer
3. See feedback, follow-up status, and conversion outcomes
4. Click any sample to see full details

### Sample Usage Log

The main samples page shows:

- **Recent samples** (last 50 by default)
- **Sample details**: Product, customer, date, quantity
- **Feedback summary**: Quick view of customer reaction
- **Follow-up status**: Outstanding follow-ups highlighted
- **Conversion status**: Whether sample led to an order

### Filters and Search

Filter your sample history by:
- **Date range**: Last week, month, quarter, year
- **Customer**: Specific account
- **Product**: Particular wine or category
- **Conversion status**: Converted vs. not converted
- **Follow-up status**: Pending follow-ups only

## Best Practices

### 1. Log Samples Immediately

**Why**: Memory fades quickly. Customer reactions and specific comments are most accurate when recorded immediately.

**How**:
- Use the mobile web app during customer visits
- Have your iPad or phone ready during tastings
- Log samples before leaving the customer's location

### 2. Be Specific with Feedback

**Poor feedback**: "They liked it"
**Good feedback**: "Loved the minerality, compared it favorably to their current Chablis which sells at $32. Mentioned they'd like to taste 3-4 more Burgundies next visit."

**Include**:
- Specific flavor notes the customer mentioned
- Comparisons to wines they currently carry
- Price points discussed
- Volume potential
- Decision-making timeline

### 3. Track Follow-ups Diligently

**Best practice**:
- Mark "Needs Follow-up" for any positive or neutral response
- Set a specific follow-up date (typically 3-7 days after tasting)
- Add follow-up to your calendar or task list
- Document the follow-up conversation result

**Why it matters**: Most sample conversions happen within 1-2 weeks. Quick follow-up dramatically increases conversion rates.

### 4. Monitor Your Budget

**Monthly Sample Allowance**: Your tenant settings define your monthly sample budget (default: 60 bottles)

**Budget management tips**:
- Check your remaining allowance weekly
- Prioritize samples for high-potential accounts
- Use partial bottles for tastings when appropriate
- Request budget increases for special events or launches

### 5. Focus on High-Conversion Products

**Use analytics to identify**:
- Which wines have the highest conversion rates
- Which price points convert best
- Which customers convert most frequently
- Which suppliers have the most compelling samples

**Strategy**:
- Lead with proven converters for new accounts
- Use high-conversion samples for upselling existing customers
- Reserve lower-conversion samples for very specific customer requests

### 6. Leverage Seasonal Patterns

**Track**:
- Which samples convert better in different seasons
- Pre-holiday sampling strategies
- Summer vs. winter wine preferences

**Example**: RosÃ© samples may convert better in March-April as customers plan summer lists, while full-bodied reds perform better in September-October.

### 7. Qualify Customers Before Sampling

**Not all customers are equal**. Prioritize samples for:
- New accounts with high potential volume
- Existing customers looking to expand their lists
- Accounts with upcoming menu changes
- Customers who have converted samples previously

**Lower priority**:
- Customers who rarely convert samples
- Very price-sensitive accounts unless it's a value wine
- Customers in financial difficulty

## Mobile Usage

### Optimized for iPad and Phone

The sample management interface is fully responsive:

**Features available on mobile**:
- Quick sample assignment
- Voice-to-text for feedback entry (iOS/Android)
- Barcode scanning for product selection (if enabled)
- Photo capture for label/shelf placement
- Offline mode for tastings in cellars without signal

### Voice Entry Tips

1. Enable microphone access when prompted
2. Tap the microphone icon in the feedback field
3. Speak clearly: "Customer loved the cherry and spice notes, compared it to their current Pinot at twenty-eight dollars, will decide within a week"
4. Review and edit the transcribed text
5. Save the sample entry

### Offline Mode

**Handling**: If you lose connection during a tasting:
- Samples are saved locally on your device
- Automatic sync when connection is restored
- Visual indicator shows pending syncs
- No data loss even if you close the app

## Troubleshooting

### "Sample budget exceeded" Error

**Problem**: Trying to log more samples than your monthly allowance

**Solutions**:
1. Check your remaining budget: Sales > Samples > Budget Tracker
2. Wait until next month when budget resets
3. Contact your manager to request a budget increase
4. Use half-bottle samples (enter quantity as 0.5)

### Can't Find a Product

**Problem**: Product not appearing in the sample selection dropdown

**Solutions**:
1. Ensure the product is marked as "Active" in the system
2. Check if it's flagged as "Sample Only" (should appear)
3. Try searching by SKU code instead of product name
4. Contact admin to verify the product exists in the catalog

### Sample Not Showing in Customer History

**Problem**: Recently logged sample doesn't appear on customer page

**Solutions**:
1. Refresh the page (may take a few seconds to sync)
2. Check that you selected the correct customer when logging
3. Verify the sample was successfully saved (check Samples page)
4. Clear browser cache if the issue persists

### Follow-up Reminders Not Working

**Problem**: Not receiving reminders for sample follow-ups

**Solutions**:
1. Verify "Needs Follow-up" was checked when logging the sample
2. Check your notification settings: Sales > Settings
3. Ensure your email notifications are enabled
4. Follow-ups appear in the Tasks section - check there directly

### Conversion Not Tracking

**Problem**: Customer ordered but sample shows as not converted

**Solutions**:
1. Sample conversion is automatic when an order contains the sampled SKU within 30 days
2. If the order was placed but doesn't show as converted:
   - Verify the exact same SKU was ordered
   - Check that the order is within 30 days of the sample date
   - Contact support if the SKU matches and timeframe is correct
3. Manual conversion: Click the sample > "Mark as Converted"

## Advanced Features

### Bulk Sample Import

For trade shows or large events:

1. Download the sample import template: Sales > Samples > Import
2. Fill in the CSV with:
   - Customer IDs or names
   - SKU codes
   - Quantities
   - Date of tasting
   - Feedback (optional)
3. Upload the completed CSV
4. Review and confirm the import
5. Samples are logged in bulk

### Sample Conversion Attribution

**30-Day Window**: If a customer orders a product within 30 days of sampling it, the sample is automatically marked as "Converted"

**Attribution Logic**:
- System checks all orders for the customer
- Matches SKU codes between samples and order lines
- Updates the sample record with conversion status
- Calculates the revenue attributed to that sample

### Sample Analytics Integration

Sample data feeds into multiple analytics views:

- **Sample Conversion Dashboard**: Conversion rates by product, customer, rep
- **ROI Calculator**: Cost of samples vs. revenue generated
- **Rep Leaderboard**: Top-performing reps by sample conversion
- **Product Performance**: Which wines convert best from samples

See the [Sample Analytics Guide](./SAMPLE_ANALYTICS_GUIDE.md) for details.
