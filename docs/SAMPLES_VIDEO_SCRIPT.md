### SCENE 2: Sample Tracking Basics (3 min)

**[SCREEN: Login to Leora, navigate to Sales > Samples]**

**NARRATOR**:
"Sample tracking starts with logging every sample you give to customers. Let's see how quick and easy this is."

**[SCREEN: Click 'Log Sample Usage' button]**

"Click the 'Log Sample Usage' button. You'll see a simple form."

**[SCREEN: Fill out sample form step-by-step]**

**NARRATOR demonstrates filling form**:
"First, select your customer - start typing their name, and the system auto-completes. I'll choose 'Wine Bar ABC'."

"Next, select the product. I'm sampling a Burgundy Chardonnay today."

"Quantity defaults to 1 bottle, but you can adjust if you sampled more."

"The tasted date defaults to today - just confirm it's accurate."

**[SCREEN: Focus on feedback field]**

"Now for feedback. You have two options: quick feedback templates or custom notes. I'll choose 'Loved it' from the templates, then add specific notes: 'Customer loved the minerality, compared favorably to their current Chablis at $32.'"

**[SCREEN: Check 'Needs Follow-up' checkbox]**

"If the customer wants to think about it, check 'Needs Follow-up'. This ensures you don't forget to circle back."

**[SCREEN: Click Save]**

"Click Save, and you're done! The sample is logged."

**[SCREEN: Show sample appearing in the usage log]**

**NARRATOR**:
"The sample immediately appears in your usage log. You can see all your recent samples here, along with their status - whether they've converted to orders or still need follow-up."

**[SCREEN: Navigate to a customer detail page, show Sample History tab]**

"You can also view all samples for a specific customer by going to their profile and clicking the 'Sample History' tab. This shows you everything you've ever sampled to this account."

### SCENE 3: Sample Analytics Dashboard (4 min)

**[SCREEN: Navigate to Sales > Analytics > Samples]**

**NARRATOR**:
"Now let's see how your samples are performing. Navigate to Sales > Analytics > Samples."

**[SCREEN: Analytics dashboard loads, showing summary metrics at top]**

"The dashboard starts with summary metrics. Here you can see:
- Total samples distributed this month
- Your conversion rate - in this case, 35%
- Revenue attributed to samples
- Average revenue per sample
- And how long it typically takes for samples to convert"

**[SCREEN: Point to conversion rate]**

"A 35% conversion rate is solid! That means over a third of your samples result in orders. The industry average is around 25%, so this rep is doing well."

**[SCREEN: Scroll down to Top Performers chart]**

**NARRATOR**:
"Below, we see the Top Performers - which wines convert best from samples."

**[SCREEN: Click on the best-performing product]**

"This Burgundy Chardonnay has a 56% conversion rate! Let's click it to see more details."

**[SCREEN: Drill-down view showing sample history for this SKU]**

"We can see exactly when samples were given, which customers received them, and which converted. This SKU clearly resonates with customers - you should lead with this for new accounts!"

**[SCREEN: Navigate back, scroll to Rep Leaderboard]**

**NARRATOR**:
"The Rep Leaderboard shows how team members compare."

**[SCREEN: Point to top performer]**

"John is crushing it with a 43% conversion rate and $15,000 in attributed revenue. What's he doing differently? Let's find out."

**[SCREEN: Click on John's name, see his sample distribution]**

"Looking at John's samples, he focuses on premium Burgundies and follows up within 5 days. That's a best practice worth sharing with the team!"

**[SCREEN: Navigate to date range selector]**

**NARRATOR**:
"You can view analytics for different time periods using the date range selector. Last 7 days for recent trends, last 90 days for broader patterns, or custom ranges for specific campaigns."

**[SCREEN: Change date range to last 90 days]**

"Let's look at the last 90 days to see trends over time."

**[SCREEN: Show trend chart]**

"The trend chart shows conversion rates climbing over the quarter. Seasonal pattern? Improved follow-up? The data tells the story."

**[SCREEN: Click Export to CSV]**

**NARRATOR**:
"You can export all this data to CSV for deeper analysis in Excel, or use the PDF export for presentations to management or suppliers."

### SCENE 4: AI Product Recommendations (3 min)

**[SCREEN: Navigate to a customer's order page]**

**NARRATOR**:
"Now for one of the coolest features - AI-powered product recommendations. Let's create an order for Wine Bar ABC."

**[SCREEN: Add a product to the cart]**

"I'll start by adding a case of Pinot Noir to their cart."

**[SCREEN: Click 'Get AI Recommendations' button]**

"Now watch this - click 'Get AI Recommendations'."

**[SCREEN: Loading spinner, then recommendations appear]**

**NARRATOR**:
"The AI analyzes this customer's purchase history, sample tastings, your notes, and the current order contents to suggest complementary products."

**[SCREEN: Show first recommendation]**

"Here's the first recommendation: a Meursault from the same producer. Confidence score is 87% - that's high!"

**[SCREEN: Read the reasoning aloud]**

**NARRATOR reads**:
"'Customer frequently orders premium Burgundy whites and recently gave positive feedback on a similar Meursault sample. This complements their current order of red Burgundy.'

The AI is connecting the dots for you! It remembered the sample feedback and knows this customer likes premium Burgundy."

**[SCREEN: Show suggested quantity and pricing]**

"It even suggests a quantity - 3 bottles - and shows the pricing. Stock status is green, so we have it available."

**[SCREEN: Click 'Add to Order']**

"Click 'Add to Order' and it goes right into the cart. That easy!"

**[SCREEN: Show second and third recommendations]**

**NARRATOR**:
"Let's look at the other suggestions. A Rosé for summer - interesting! The AI knows it's approaching summer and this customer has ordered Rosé in past Mays."

**[SCREEN: Click thumbs up on good recommendation]**

"If a recommendation is great, give it a thumbs up. This helps the AI learn what works for this customer."

**[SCREEN: Click thumbs down on poor recommendation]**

"If a suggestion doesn't make sense, thumbs down and tell the AI why. 'Price too high' or 'Customer prefers different style.' The AI gets smarter over time."

**[SCREEN: Complete the order]**

**NARRATOR**:
"Let's add that Rosé too and complete the order. Thanks to AI, we upsold from one product to three - increased the order value by 40%!"

### SCENE 5: Automated Triggers (2 min)

**[SCREEN: Navigate to Sales > Settings > Triggers]**

**NARRATOR**:
"Automated triggers ensure you never miss a follow-up. Let's look at how they work."

**[SCREEN: Show list of configured triggers]**

"Here you see four trigger types:
- Sample No Order: Fires when a sample doesn't convert
- First Order: Welcomes new customers
- Customer Timing: Proactive outreach based on patterns
- Burn Rate: Alerts for declining order frequency"

**[SCREEN: Click on Sample No Order trigger]**

**NARRATOR**:
"The Sample No Order trigger is set to fire 7 days after giving a sample if the customer hasn't ordered yet."

**[SCREEN: Show trigger configuration]**

"It creates a phone call task with medium priority and a description like 'Follow up on Chardonnay sample from October 18th'."

**[SCREEN: Navigate to Tasks page]**

"These tasks appear in your task list automatically."

**[SCREEN: Show triggered task in task list]**

"Here's a triggered task - see the lightning bolt icon? That means it was auto-created. You didn't forget this follow-up - the system remembered for you!"

**[SCREEN: Click task, show details]**

"Click it to see which sample needs follow-up. Make the call, log the outcome, and mark it complete."

**[SCREEN: Show First Order trigger example]**

**NARRATOR**:
"The First Order trigger is equally powerful. When a new customer places their first order, the system automatically creates a thank you task for the next day. Great customer service happens automatically!"

### SCENE 6: Best Practices & Tips (2 min)

**[SCREEN: Split-screen showing mobile and desktop]**

**NARRATOR**:
"Before we wrap up, here are some best practices for getting the most from Phase 3."

**[SCREEN: Show mobile sample logging]**

**TIP 1: Log Immediately**

"Log samples immediately during or right after tastings. Use the mobile interface on your iPad or phone. You can even use voice-to-text for feedback - just tap the microphone icon and speak your notes."

**[SCREEN: Show analytics dashboard]**

**TIP 2: Review Analytics Weekly**

"Review your analytics dashboard every week. Which products are hot? Which are cold? Adjust your sampling strategy based on the data."

**[SCREEN: Show rep leaderboard]**

**TIP 3: Learn from Top Performers**

"Managers: use the Rep Leaderboard to identify what your top performers do differently. Share those strategies with the team!"

**[SCREEN: Show AI recommendations]**

**TIP 4: Always Get AI Recommendations**

"For every order over $500, get AI recommendations. Even if you don't add everything, you might spot a perfect upsell you hadn't considered."

**[SCREEN: Show trigger settings]**

**TIP 5: Tune Your Triggers**

"Start with default trigger settings, but tune them based on results. If 7-day follow-ups feel too soon, adjust to 10 days. The system is flexible."

**[SCREEN: Show sample budget tracker]**

**TIP 6: Manage Your Budget**

"Keep an eye on your monthly sample budget. You get 60 bottles per month - use them strategically on high-potential accounts."

**[SCREEN: Summary slide with key features highlighted]**

**NARRATOR**:
"To recap:
- Log every sample for tracking and analytics
