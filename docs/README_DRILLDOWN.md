## 🎯 Key Decisions & Rationale

### Decision 1: Build Reusable Modal Component
**Why:** 80% code reuse across 15 tiles, faster implementation
**Reference:** [Full Plan - Section: Code Reusability](./DASHBOARD_DRILLDOWN_IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md#code-reusability-strategy)

### Decision 2: Prioritize by Business Value
**Why:** Deliver high-impact features first, prove value early
**Reference:** [Full Plan - Section: Prioritization Framework](./DASHBOARD_DRILLDOWN_IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md#prioritization-framework)

### Decision 3: 6-Week Timeline
**Why:** Balances thoroughness with urgency, allows for testing
**Reference:** [Visual Roadmap - Timeline](./DRILLDOWN_VISUAL_ROADMAP.md#%EF%B8%8F-6-week-implementation-timeline)

### Decision 4: Start with At Risk Accounts
**Why:** Highest business impact (prevents churn), data is ready
**Reference:** [Full Plan - Phase 1](./DASHBOARD_DRILLDOWN_IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md#phase-1-high-priority-tiles-week-2-3)

### Decision 5: Use Feature Flags
**Why:** Gradual rollout, easy rollback, beta testing
**Reference:** [Full Plan - Rollback Plan](./DASHBOARD_DRILLDOWN_IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md#rollback-plan)

---

## 📋 Frequently Asked Questions

### Q: Why 6 weeks? Can we go faster?
**A:** 6 weeks allows for:
- Proper reusable component architecture (Week 1)
- Thorough testing at each phase
- Gradual rollout to catch issues early
- Developer bandwidth for other priorities

With dedicated full-time focus, could potentially reduce to 4 weeks, but quality may suffer.

**Reference:** [Executive Summary - Timeline](./DRILLDOWN_SUMMARY.md#-timeline--milestones)

---

### Q: What's the risk of breaking existing functionality?
**A:** **Low risk** with these mitigations:
- Feature flags for gradual rollout
- Preserve exact tile styling (change `div` to `button` with same classes)
- Comprehensive regression testing
- Easy rollback via git revert

**Reference:** [Full Plan - Risk Mitigation](./DASHBOARD_DRILLDOWN_IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md#risk-mitigation-strategies)

---

### Q: How much developer time is needed?
**A:** **3-4 weeks of developer effort** (less than 6-week timeline due to reusability)
- Week 1: Foundation (full focus)
- Weeks 2-6: Can work in parallel with other tasks
- QA testing: 1 week (can overlap)

**Reference:** [Executive Summary - Resources](./DRILLDOWN_SUMMARY.md#-resource-requirements)

---

### Q: Can we add more drill-downs later?
**A:** **Yes, easily!** The reusable architecture makes it simple:
1. Create API endpoint (15 min)
2. Add click handler to tile (5 min)
3. Add content rendering (30 min)
4. Test (1 hour)

**Reference:** [Quick Start - Code Templates](./DRILLDOWN_QUICK_START.md#code-templates)

---

### Q: What about mobile users?
**A:** **Full mobile support:**
- Full-screen modals on small screens
- Swipeable tabs
- Touch-friendly buttons (min 44px)
- Card views instead of tables
- Tested on real devices

**Reference:** [Visual Roadmap - Mobile Strategy](./DRILLDOWN_VISUAL_ROADMAP.md#-mobile-strategy)

---

### Q: How do we measure success?
**A:** Track these metrics:
- **Click-Through Rate:** > 30% of users click at least one tile
- **Drill-Down Engagement:** > 2 avg drill-downs per session
- **API Response Time:** < 500ms for 95th percentile
- **Error Rate:** < 0.1%
- **Mobile Usage:** > 20%

**Reference:** [Executive Summary - Success Metrics](./DRILLDOWN_SUMMARY.md#-success-metrics)

---

### Q: What if we need to rollback?
**A:** Easy rollback options:
1. **Feature flag:** Toggle `NEXT_PUBLIC_ENABLE_DRILLDOWNS=false`
2. **Git revert:** `git revert HEAD` and redeploy
3. **Partial rollback:** Disable specific drill-downs
4. **Gradual rollback:** Reduce user percentage

**Reference:** [Full Plan - Rollback Plan](./DASHBOARD_DRILLDOWN_IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md#rollback-plan)
