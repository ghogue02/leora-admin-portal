## 📊 Project Phases

### Phase 1: Discovery & Verification ✅
**Duration:** 30 minutes

**Objective:** Understand current enrichment state and requirements

**Key Findings:**
- Database had 1,879 products with **generic placeholder descriptions**
- Only 58 products (3.1%) had "accurate-v2" enrichment
- 1,821 products needed real, researched wine descriptions
- 188 batch task files already existed for research

**Actions Taken:**
- Verified database connection via Prisma
- Analyzed enrichment quality difference (generic vs accurate)
- Confirmed batches 78-188 needed processing

---

### Phase 2: Research Completion ✅

- ✅ Each wine received unique, professional content:
  - **Product Description:** 2-3 sentence professional overview
  - **Tasting Notes:** Detailed aroma, palate, and finish (object structure)
  - **Food Pairings:** 5 specific pairing recommendations (array)
  - **Serving Info:** Temperature, decanting, glassware (object)
  - **Wine Details:** Region, variety, vintage, style, ageability (object)
  - **Metadata:** Source confidence scores (0.70-0.95)
