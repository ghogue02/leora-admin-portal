## Data Models

### Lead
```typescript
{
  id, tenantId, companyName, contactName, email, phone,
  leadSource, interestLevel, estimatedValue, productsInterested,
  assignedRepId, currentStage, notes, convertedToCustomerId,
  createdAt, updatedAt
}
```

### LeadStageHistory
```typescript
{
  id, leadId, stage, enteredAt, exitedAt, movedBy, notes, winLossReason
}
```

### PipelineMetrics
```typescript
{
  totalLeads, totalValue, weightedValue,
  conversionRates: { leadToQualified, qualifiedToProposal, proposalToClosedWon, overallWinRate },
  averageTimeInStage: { [stage]: days },
  averageDaysToClose
}
```

---

## Key Features

### Forecasting Algorithm
Weighted revenue forecast using stage probabilities:
- Lead: 10% likely to close
- Qualified: 25% likely to close
- Proposal: 50% likely to close
- Negotiation: 75% likely to close
- Closed Won: 100%
- Closed Lost: 0%

**Formula**: `weightedValue = Σ (estimatedValue × stageWeight)`

### Conversion Tracking
Automatically calculates:
1. **Lead → Qualified**: How many leads become qualified
2. **Qualified → Proposal**: How many qualified leads get proposals
3. **Proposal → Won**: How many proposals close
4. **Overall Win Rate**: Total won / total closed

### Stage Performance
Tracks average time in each stage to identify:
- Bottlenecks (stages with long times)
- Fast-moving stages
- Process improvements needed

4. Optional: Add value, products, assign rep, add notes
5. Submit → Lead created in "Lead" stage

### Moving Through Funnel

2. Drag lead card to new stage column
3. For closed deals: Provide win/loss reason
4. Lead history automatically tracked

### Tracking Performance
1. Navigate to `/sales/funnel`
2. View metrics dashboard:
   - Pipeline value and forecast
   - Conversion rates
   - Time in stage
   - Funnel visualization
3. Filter by rep or date range
4. Export pipeline data

### Converting to Customer
1. Open lead in edit mode
2. Click "Convert to Customer"

## Database Schema

### Tables Created

1. **leads** - Main lead storage
   - Indexed: tenant_id, current_stage, assigned_rep_id, lead_source, interest_level, created_at

2. **lead_stage_history** - Stage transition audit trail
   - Foreign key to leads (cascade delete)
   - Indexed: lead_id, stage, entered_at

3. **sales_reps** - Sales representative data
   - Quota and commission tracking

4. **products** - Product catalog
   - For lead interest tracking

## API Endpoints Summary

| Endpoint | Method | Purpose |
|----------|--------|---------|
| `/api/sales/leads` | GET | List leads with filters |
| `/api/sales/leads` | POST | Create new lead |
| `/api/sales/leads/:id` | GET | Get lead details |
| `/api/sales/leads/:id` | PATCH | Update lead |
| `/api/sales/leads/:id` | DELETE | Delete lead |
| `/api/sales/leads/:id/stage` | PATCH | Update stage |
| `/api/sales/leads/:id/history` | GET | Get history |

## Performance Optimizations

### Database Indexing
- All filter fields indexed
- Composite indexes for common queries
- Foreign keys for integrity

### Frontend Optimizations
- Lazy loading of history
- Debounced search
- Memoized calculations
- Efficient re-renders

### Future Caching
Recommended for production:
- Redis for metrics
- Cached rep/product lists
- Cached conversion calculations

---

## Security

- **Tenant Isolation**: All queries filtered by tenantId
- **Authentication**: Session-based auth required
- **Authorization**: Users can only access their tenant's data
- **Input Validation**: All form inputs validated
- **SQL Injection Protection**: Parameterized queries
- **Soft Deletes**: Leads moved to "Closed Lost" instead of deletion

---

## Testing Recommendations

### Unit Tests
- Lead model CRUD operations
- Metrics calculations
- Conversion rate formulas
- Stage weight calculations

### Integration Tests
- API endpoints
- Database transactions
- Stage history creation
- Tenant isolation

### E2E Tests
- Create lead flow
- Drag-and-drop stage changes
- Filter and search
- Export pipeline

---

## Future Enhancements

### Immediate Opportunities
1. **Email Integration**: Automated follow-ups
2. **Task Management**: Link tasks to leads
3. **Calendar Integration**: Schedule meetings
4. **Document Storage**: Attach proposals/contracts
5. **Mobile App**: On-the-go management

### Advanced Features
1. **AI Lead Scoring**: Predictive win probability
2. **Workflow Automation**: Auto-assign, reminders
3. **Advanced Analytics**: Territory, product mix, trends
4. **CRM Integration**: Sync with external systems
5. **Custom Fields**: Tenant-specific attributes
