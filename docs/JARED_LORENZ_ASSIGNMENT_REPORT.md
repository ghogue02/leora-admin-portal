## Technical Notes

### Prisma Schema Learnings

During implementation, we discovered several schema details that are now documented:

**User Model**:
- Relation field: `salesRepProfile` (not `salesRep`)
- Compound unique key: `tenantId_email`
- Password field: `hashedPassword` (not `password`)
- Status field: `isActive` (boolean, not enum)

**SalesRep Model**:
- Territory field: `territoryName` (not `territory`)
- Quota fields: `weeklyRevenueQuota`, `monthlyRevenueQuota`, etc. (not `weeklyQuota`)
- Sample allowance: `sampleAllowancePerMonth` (not `sampleAllowance`)
- Active field: `isActive` (not `active`)

**Customer Model**:
- Relation to SalesRep: `salesRep` (not `salesRepProfile`)
- Sales rep FK: `salesRepId` (UUID)

**CustomerAssignment Model**:
- No `assignedBy` field (removed)
- No `reason` field (removed)
- Just tracks: customerId, salesRepId, assignedAt, unassignedAt

These findings have been incorporated into `CLAUDE.md` for future reference.
