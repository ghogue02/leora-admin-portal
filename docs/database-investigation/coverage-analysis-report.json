    "why_low_coverage": "\nThe 11.65% coverage (373 orders with orderlines out of 3,202 total orders) appears to be due to:\n1. Data Distribution: The 11828 orderlines are distributed across 0 orders\n2. Average of 0.0 lines per order (11,828 / 373 = 31.7 lines/order)\n3. This suggests these are BULK/WHOLESALE orders with many line items\n4. The remaining -159 orders likely represent:\n   - Small retail orders (may not have been migrated from Well Crafted)\n   - Orders created in Lovable natively (no WC equivalent)\n   - Orders that failed to import orderlines during migration\n  ",
    "are_orphaned_orders_problem": "\nNo problem detected:\n0 orders reference customers that don't exist in the database.\nThis is a data integrity issue that should be resolved by either:\n1. Importing the missing customers\n2. Deleting the orphaned orders\n3. Reassigning the orders to valid customers\n  ",
    "can_achieve_70_percent": "\nCurrent State:\n- Well Crafted had 7,774 OrderLines total\n- We imported 7,017 OrderLines (90.3% of WC data)\n- 757 were skipped (no Order mapping in Lovable)\n\nMaximum Achievable Coverage:\n- If those 757 skipped orderlines belong to Infinity orders (assuming avg 0.0 lines/order)\n- That would add ~Infinity more orders with lines\n- New coverage would be: Infinity%\n\nConclusion: YES, we CAN achieve 70% coverage by importing the missing 757 orderlines.\n  ",
    "what_to_reach_70_percent": "\nTo reach 70% coverage:\n- Need 2242 orders with orderlines (70% of 3,202)\n- Currently have 159 orders with orderlines\n- Need 1869 MORE orders with orderlines\n\nOptions:\n1. Import the 757 skipped orderlines (if they map to ~Infinity unique orders)\n2. Migrate more orders from Well Crafted (if they exist)\n3. Accept that 11.65% is the realistic maximum if:\n   - The other 2,829 orders are Lovable-only (no WC equivalent)\n   - Or they're small orders that WC didn't track orderlines for\n  "
