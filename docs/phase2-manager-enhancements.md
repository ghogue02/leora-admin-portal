## Technology Stack

- **React**: Component framework
- **Next.js 15**: App router, server components
- **TypeScript**: Type safety
- **Recharts**: Data visualization
- **Radix UI**: Dialog, Tabs, Badge components
- **Tailwind CSS**: Styling
- **Prisma**: Database ORM
- **date-fns**: Date calculations

## Database Queries

All queries use Prisma ORM with:
- Tenant isolation
- Date range filtering
- Aggregation functions
- Efficient joins
- Order status filtering (excludes CANCELLED)

## User Experience

### Click Interactions
1. **Rep Name** → Opens detailed drill-down modal
2. **Territory Card** → Opens territory account breakdown
3. **Tab Navigation** → Switch between views
4. **Modal Tabs** → Navigate within drill-down

### Visual Feedback
- Hover effects on clickable elements
- Loading states with spinners
- Color-coded performance indicators
- Badge system for status
- Responsive grid layouts

## Mobile Responsiveness

All components include:
- Responsive grid layouts (`md:grid-cols-*`)
- Horizontal scrolling for tables
- Touch-friendly button sizes
- Mobile-optimized modals
- Flexible typography

## Performance Considerations

- Lazy loading of drill-down data (only loads when modal opens)
- Efficient database queries with aggregations
- Client-side state management
- Memoized calculations
- Pagination for large datasets

## Future Enhancements

1. Real-time updates with websockets
2. Export to Excel/CSV
3. Customizable date ranges
4. Advanced filtering options
5. Drill-down comparison (compare 2 reps)
6. Historical trend analysis
7. Goal tracking and alerts
8. Integration with CRM systems
