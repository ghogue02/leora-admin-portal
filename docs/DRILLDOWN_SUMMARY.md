```
/api/portal/dashboard/drilldown/[type]/route.ts
├── Authenticate user
├── Fetch tenant-scoped data
├── Calculate insights
└── Return structured JSON
```

### State Management
```typescript
useDrilldown() hook
├── Modal state (open/close)
├── Drill-down type
├── Parameters (e.g., customerId)
└── Handlers (openDrilldown, closeDrilldown)
```
