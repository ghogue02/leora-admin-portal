## üêõ Troubleshooting

### Map Not Loading
**Problem**: White screen or error at `/sales/customers/map`

**Solutions**:
1. Check `NEXT_PUBLIC_MAPBOX_TOKEN` is set in `.env`
2. Verify token is valid at https://account.mapbox.com/
3. Check browser console for errors
4. Ensure customers have `latitude` and `longitude` values

### No Insights Showing
**Problem**: "No insights available" message

**Cause**: Customer needs minimum 3 orders

**Solution**:
- Test with a customer that has 5+ orders
- Add more order data for testing
- Check API endpoint returns 200: `/api/sales/customers/[id]/insights`

### YTD Revenue Shows $0
**Problem**: All customers show $0.00 YTD revenue

**Solutions**:
1. Check orders have `deliveredAt` dates in current year
2. Verify orders are not all CANCELLED status
3. Check API response includes `ytdRevenue` field
4. Run query to verify data exists:
```sql
SELECT COUNT(*), SUM(total)
FROM orders
WHERE delivered_at >= '2025-01-01'
AND status != 'CANCELLED';
```

### Charts Not Rendering
**Problem**: Product History shows error or blank

**Solutions**:
1. Check browser console for errors
2. Verify Recharts is installed: `npm list recharts`
3. Check API returns proper data structure
4. Test API endpoint directly: `/api/sales/customers/[id]/product-history?type=timeline`

### CSV Export Not Working
**Problem**: CSV download fails or is empty

**Solutions**:
1. Check browser allows downloads
2. Verify product data exists for customer
3. Check browser console for errors
4. Test with customer that has order history
