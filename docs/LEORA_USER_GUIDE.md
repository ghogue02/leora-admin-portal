## Tips & Best Practices

### For Saved Queries

1. **Use descriptive names**: "Top 10 Customers - Monthly" is better than "Query 1"
2. **Add categories**: Makes queries easier to find later
3. **Review usage stats**: See which queries you use most
4. **Share useful queries**: Help your team with shared queries
5. **Clean up regularly**: Delete queries you don't use

### For Scheduled Reports

1. **Start with one report**: Get comfortable before adding more
2. **Choose realistic times**: When will you actually read it?
3. **Match frequency to need**: Daily for hot topics, weekly for trends
4. **Use descriptive names**: "Monday Territory Check" vs "Report 1"
5. **Test with yourself first**: Use your email before scheduling for others
6. **Pause when on vacation**: Avoid inbox clutter

### General Tips

1. **Combine features**: Save queries you use in scheduled reports
2. **Use templates as starting points**: Customize them to your needs
3. **Check history when stuck**: Revisit successful queries
4. **Share with team**: Help others with your best queries

## Common Questions

### Can I edit a saved query?
Currently, you can delete and recreate. Edit functionality coming soon.

### Can I share queries with my team?
Yes! When saving a query, check the "Share with team" option.

### How many queries can I save?
There's no hard limit, but we recommend keeping your favorites organized.

### Will scheduled reports actually send emails?
The scheduling system is ready, but email delivery is being implemented separately. You can configure reports now, and they'll start sending once email is enabled.

### Can I have multiple scheduled reports?
Yes! Create as many as you need. Each can have different frequencies and times.

### What if I want to change the time of a report?
Delete the old report and create a new one with the updated time. Edit functionality coming soon.

### Can I send reports to multiple people?
Currently one email per report. For multiple recipients, create multiple reports or use email forwarding.

### What happens if LeorAI can't answer my query?
Saved queries execute just like manual queries - you'll get LeorAI's best response.
