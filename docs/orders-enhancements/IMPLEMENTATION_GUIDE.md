# Orders Section Enhancements - Implementation Guide

## Overview

This document describes the Phase 2 orders enhancements completed for the Leora sales system. All features have been implemented following best practices for role-based access, inventory management, and purchase order tracking.

## Features Implemented

### 1. Role-Based Order Visibility ✅

**Location:** `/src/app/api/sales/orders/route.ts`

**Implementation:**
- Orders are automatically filtered by sales rep's assigned customers
- The existing API already implements this via the `customer.salesRepId` filter
- Managers and admins can see all orders through role checks

**Code:**
```typescript
const where: Prisma.OrderWhereInput = {
  tenantId,
  customer: {
    salesRepId, // Filters to only show orders for assigned customers
  },
};
```

**Roles:**
- `sales.rep` - See only their customer orders
- `sales.manager` - Can see all orders in their territory (via role check)
- `sales.admin` - Can see all orders

### 2. Inventory Oversell Prevention ✅

**Location:** `/src/lib/inventory/reservation.ts`

**Features:**
- Real-time inventory availability checks
- Reservation system to hold inventory during order creation
- Low stock warnings (< 10 units)
- Out of stock blocking
- Automatic reservation release on order cancellation
- Inventory update on order fulfillment

**API Endpoints:**
- `POST /api/sales/orders/inventory-check` - Check before order submission
- Integration with catalog to show availability

**Database Schema:**
```sql
CREATE TABLE "InventoryReservation" (
  "id" UUID PRIMARY KEY,
  "tenantId" UUID NOT NULL,
  "skuId" UUID NOT NULL,
  "orderId" UUID NOT NULL,
  "quantity" INTEGER NOT NULL,
  "reservedAt" TIMESTAMP NOT NULL,
  "expiresAt" TIMESTAMP,
  "releasedAt" TIMESTAMP,
  "status" TEXT NOT NULL DEFAULT 'ACTIVE'
);
```

**Usage Flow:**
1. User adds items to cart
2. Before order submit: Call `/api/sales/orders/inventory-check`
3. System checks: `onHand - allocated - reserved >= requestedQuantity`
4. If available: Reserve inventory with `reserveInventory()`
5. If out of stock: Block order and show error
6. On order fulfillment: Update inventory with `fulfillInventoryReservation()`
7. On order cancellation: Release reservation with `releaseInventoryReservation()`

### 3. Promotion & Closeout Lists ✅

**Location:** `/src/app/sales/promotions/page.tsx`

**Database Schema:**
```sql
ALTER TABLE "Product" ADD COLUMN "isPromotion" BOOLEAN DEFAULT false;
ALTER TABLE "Product" ADD COLUMN "promotionStartDate" TIMESTAMP;
ALTER TABLE "Product" ADD COLUMN "promotionEndDate" TIMESTAMP;
ALTER TABLE "Product" ADD COLUMN "promotionDiscount" DECIMAL(5,2);
ALTER TABLE "Product" ADD COLUMN "isCloseout" BOOLEAN DEFAULT false;
```

**Features:**
- Dedicated `/sales/promotions` page
- Tabbed interface: Promotions vs. Closeouts
- Shows discount percentage
- Displays days remaining for promotions
- Shows inventory availability
- Direct links to catalog

**API Endpoint:**
- `GET /api/sales/promotions` - Returns active promotions and closeouts

**Display:**
- Promotions: Shows items with `isPromotion = true` and active dates
- Closeouts: Shows items with `isCloseout = true`
- Both show: Discount %, availability, pricing, days remaining

### 4. Purchase Order (PO) Integration ✅

**Location:** `/src/app/sales/orders/purchase-orders/`

**Database Schema:**
```sql
CREATE TABLE "PurchaseOrder" (
  "id" UUID PRIMARY KEY,
  "tenantId" UUID NOT NULL,
  "poNumber" TEXT NOT NULL,
  "supplierId" UUID,
  "status" TEXT DEFAULT 'PENDING',
  "orderedAt" TIMESTAMP NOT NULL,
  "expectedAt" TIMESTAMP,
  "receivedAt" TIMESTAMP,
  "notes" TEXT
);

CREATE TABLE "PurchaseOrderLine" (
  "id" UUID PRIMARY KEY,
  "tenantId" UUID NOT NULL,
  "purchaseOrderId" UUID NOT NULL,
  "skuId" UUID NOT NULL,
  "quantity" INTEGER NOT NULL,
  "unitCost" DECIMAL(10,2) NOT NULL,
  "receivedQuantity" INTEGER DEFAULT 0
);
```

**Features:**
- PO creation with line items
- Supplier tracking
- Status management: PENDING → APPROVED → ORDERED → RECEIVED
- Expected arrival dates (ETA)
- Email notifications (pending backend setup)
- Inventory update on PO receipt

**API Endpoints:**
- `GET /api/sales/orders/purchase-orders` - List all POs
- `POST /api/sales/orders/purchase-orders` - Create new PO
- `POST /api/sales/orders/[orderId]/receive` - Mark PO as received

**Permissions:**
- Requires `sales.admin`, `sales.manager`, or `warehouse.manager` role

**Workflow:**
1. Manager creates PO with items and expected date
2. PO status: PENDING → APPROVED → ORDERED
3. When received: Call `/api/sales/orders/[id]/receive`
4. System updates inventory automatically
5. ETA shown in catalog for backordered items

## Integration Points

### Catalog Updates

**Location:** `/src/app/api/sales/catalog/route.ts`

**Changes:**
- Now uses `getInventoryStatus()` to include reservations
- Shows `lowStock` and `outOfStock` flags
- Displays promotion and closeout badges
- Shows available quantity with reservations factored in

### Order Cancellation

**Location:** `/src/app/api/sales/orders/[orderId]/cancel/route.ts`

**Changes:**
- Now calls `releaseInventoryReservation()` on cancellation
- Frees up reserved inventory for other orders
- Proper transaction handling

## Database Migrations

**Location:** `/prisma/migrations/20251026_add_promotions_and_po/migration.sql`

**Run Migration:**
```bash
npx prisma migrate deploy
```

**Includes:**
- Product promotion fields
- PurchaseOrder tables
- InventoryReservation tables
- All indexes and foreign keys

## Testing Checklist

### Role-Based Filtering
- [ ] Sales rep sees only their customer orders
- [ ] Manager can access all orders
- [ ] Admin can access all orders

### Inventory System
- [ ] Low stock warning shows when < 10 units
- [ ] Order blocked when out of stock
- [ ] Inventory reserved on order submit
- [ ] Reservation released on order cancel
- [ ] Inventory updated on order fulfillment

### Promotions
- [ ] Promotions page loads correctly
- [ ] Discount percentage displays
- [ ] Days remaining shows for active promotions
- [ ] Closeouts display separately
- [ ] Links to catalog work

### Purchase Orders
- [ ] PO creation works
- [ ] PO list displays correctly
- [ ] PO receive updates inventory
- [ ] Only managers/admins can access POs
- [ ] ETA shows in catalog

## Performance Considerations

1. **Inventory Checks**: Uses raw SQL for efficiency with reservations
2. **Batch Processing**: Catalog loads all SKUs then processes inventory in parallel
3. **Indexing**: Added indexes on promotion flags and PO status
4. **Caching**: Consider adding Redis cache for inventory availability

## Security

1. **Role Checks**: All PO operations require manager/admin roles
2. **Tenant Isolation**: All queries filtered by tenantId
3. **Order Access**: Sales reps can only cancel their own customer orders
4. **Transaction Safety**: All inventory operations use database transactions

## Future Enhancements

1. **Email Notifications**:
   - Low stock alerts
   - PO received notifications
   - Promotion expiring warnings

2. **Inventory Forecasting**:
   - Predict stock-outs
   - Automated PO suggestions
   - Seasonal demand patterns

3. **Advanced PO Features**:
   - Partial receipts
   - Quality control tracking
   - Return to supplier workflow

4. **Analytics**:
   - Promotion effectiveness tracking
   - Inventory turnover reports
   - Fill rate analysis
