## Migration Notes

### Upgrading from Phase 2

**Database Migration**:
1. Backup database before migration
2. Run `npx prisma migrate deploy`
3. Seed sample metrics: `npm run db:seed:sample-metrics`
4. Verify: Check SampleUsage table exists

**Environment Variables**:
Add to `.env`:
```bash
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=sk-ant-api03-...
SAMPLE_ATTRIBUTION_WINDOW_DAYS=30
SAMPLE_BUDGET_DEFAULT_MONTHLY=60
```

**Cron Jobs**:
Set up two new cron jobs:
- Sample metrics calculation (daily 2 AM)
- Trigger processing (every 6 hours)

**User Training**:
- Sales reps: Sample logging workflow
- Managers: Analytics dashboard
- Admins: Trigger configuration

### Breaking Changes

**None** - Phase 3 is fully backward compatible.

All existing features continue to work as before. Phase 3 is additive only.
