# Wine Product Enrichment System - Executive Summary

## Problem Statement

The current wine product database contains 1,879 products with generic, template-based descriptions that result in duplicate tasting notes and poor customer experience. Products need accurate, unique, wine-specific enrichment data.

## Solution Overview

A comprehensive, automated wine enrichment system that:

1. **Extracts wine details** from product names (producer, vintage, region, varietal)
2. **Searches the web** for accurate wine information from authoritative sources
3. **Generates unique tasting notes** using Claude 3.5 Sonnet
4. **Validates uniqueness** to prevent duplicate content
5. **Processes efficiently** using batch processing with checkpoints

---

## System Architecture

### High-Level Flow

```
Product → Extract Details → Web Search → LLM Generation → Validation → Database
```

### Key Components

1. **WineDetailsExtractor**: Parses product data to extract wine attributes
2. **WineInformationResolver**: Multi-tiered web search strategy
3. **TastingNotesGenerator**: LLM-based unique content generation
4. **UniquenessValidator**: Prevents duplicate content
5. **BatchEnrichmentEngine**: Orchestrates processing with error handling

### Multi-Tiered Search Strategy

```
Level 1: Exact Match (Producer + Wine + Vintage) → Confidence: 0.85-1.00
    ↓ (if not found)
Level 2: Producer + Wine Style              → Confidence: 0.70-0.85
    ↓ (if not found)
Level 3: Varietal + Region                  → Confidence: 0.50-0.70
    ↓ (if not found)
Level 4: Generic Varietal                   → Confidence: 0.30-0.50
```

- 3-layer validation (exact duplicates, similarity scoring, quality checks)
- Generic phrase detection prevents template-like content

### Scalability
- Batch processing with concurrency (3 parallel requests)
- Checkpoint system every 50 products
- Retry logic with exponential backoff
- Processes 1,879 products in ~1.5 hours

### Quality Assurance
- Multi-component quality scoring (0-100)
- Minimum acceptable score: 70
- Comprehensive metadata tracking
- Audit trail for debugging and improvement

### Reliability
- Checkpoint system prevents data loss
- Error handling for all failure scenarios
- Failed product queue for manual review
- Resume from last checkpoint on restart
