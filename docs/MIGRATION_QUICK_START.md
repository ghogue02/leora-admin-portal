## ‚ö†Ô∏è Critical Success Factors

### 1. Analytics Accuracy (HIGHEST PRIORITY)
**Why:** ARPDD is the #1 KPI for the entire business
**Action:**
- Migrate `analytics.ts` first with full test coverage
- Compare output with original system using real data
- Manual validation of all calculations
- Get sign-off from business stakeholders

### 2. Multi-Tenant Isolation
**Why:** Data leakage would be catastrophic
**Action:**
- Implement Row Level Security (RLS) in Supabase
- Test cross-tenant access prevention thoroughly
- Automated security tests for all queries
- Middleware to enforce `tenantId` filtering

### 3. Database Performance
**Why:** System has 70+ models with complex queries
**Action:**
- Migrate all 50+ database indexes
- Use materialized views for expensive aggregations
- Implement caching for dashboard metrics
- Load testing with realistic data volumes

### 4. Authentication & Authorization
**Why:** RBAC is critical for security
**Action:**
- Preserve all role-based permissions
- Test session management thoroughly
- Verify refresh token rotation
- Test across both portals (customer + sales)

### 5. Order Flow Integrity
**Why:** Order errors directly impact revenue
**Action:**
- Test cart pricing calculations extensively
- Verify inventory checks work correctly
- Test order status transitions
- Validate invoice generation accuracy

## üö® Known Challenges

### 1. Prisma to Lovable Database
**Challenge:** Lovable may not support Prisma ORM
**Solution:**
- Use Supabase client directly (already in dependencies)
- Rewrite complex Prisma queries as SQL
- Create data access layer abstraction
- Test all queries against real data

### 2. AI Integration (Copilot)
**Challenge:** Anthropic SDK may not work in Lovable
**Solution:**
- Treat as optional (Priority 3)
- Use REST API directly with fetch
- Implement server-side proxy for API keys
- Consider deferring to post-migration enhancement

### 3. Background Jobs
**Challenge:** Weekly metrics, health assessments need scheduling
**Solution:**
- Use Supabase Edge Functions for cron jobs
- Implement cron endpoints for external services
- Test job reliability and error handling
- Set up monitoring for job failures

### 4. Complex Analytics
**Challenge:** 500+ lines of business logic in `analytics.ts`
**Solution:**
- Port carefully with comprehensive unit tests
- Use database views for common aggregations
- Consider materialized views for performance
- Implement caching layer for expensive calculations
