Let's get started!"

**[TRANSITION: Fade to warehouse footage]**

**VOICEOVER:**
"Before we dive into the software, let's talk about why warehouse organization matters. A well-organized warehouse can reduce picking time by 30-50%, minimize errors, and speed up order fulfillment. Leora's system makes this easy by automating location assignment and pick route optimization."

## Part 1: Assigning Inventory Locations (3 minutes)

**[SCREEN: Navigate to Warehouse > Inventory Locations]**

**VOICEOVER:**
"First, let's learn how to assign locations to your inventory. Click on the Warehouse menu, then Inventory Locations."

**[SCREEN: Show inventory location list, highlight products without locations]**

**VOICEOVER:**
"Here you can see all your products. Products highlighted in yellow don't have locations assigned yet. Let's assign a location to this Burgundy Chardonnay."

**[SCREEN: Click 'Assign Location' button]**

**VOICEOVER:**
"Click the Assign Location button. You'll see three dropdowns: Aisle, Row, and Shelf."

**[SCREEN: Select Aisle A, Row 1, Bottom]**

**VOICEOVER:**
"Our warehouse aisles are labeled A through E, with A closest to the loading dock where we keep our fastest-moving products. This Chardonnay sells well, so we'll put it in Aisle A, Row 1, on the Bottom shelf. The bottom shelf is easiest to access, perfect for items we pick frequently."

**[SCREEN: Click Save, show location assigned: A-1-Bottom]**

**VOICEOVER:**
"Click Save, and the location is assigned immediately. Notice the location format: Aisle-Row-Shelf. This makes it easy to find products when picking."

**[SCREEN: Show pickOrder field: 1011]**

**VOICEOVER:**
"Leora automatically calculates a 'pick order' number. This determines the sequence products should be picked to minimize walking. Lower numbers are picked first. We'll see how this works when we generate a pick sheet."

**[SCREEN: Show bulk import button]**

**VOICEOVER:**
"For large inventories, you can import locations in bulk using a CSV file. Just click Bulk Import, download the template, fill it out in Excel, and upload it back. Much faster than manual assignment!"

## Part 2: Using the Warehouse Map (2 minutes)

**[SCREEN: Navigate to Warehouse > Map View]**

**VOICEOVER:**
"The warehouse map gives you a visual overview of your entire warehouse. This is Aisle A, and each box represents a location."

**[SCREEN: Show map with colored locations]**

**VOICEOVER:**
"Blue boxes contain inventory. Gray boxes are empty. Green boxes are fast-moving products. You can click any location to see what's stored there."

**[SCREEN: Click location A-3-Middle]**

**VOICEOVER:**
"For example, clicking A-3-Middle shows me there are 24 bottles of Napa Cabernet here. The map updates in real-time as inventory moves."

**[SCREEN: Show filter controls]**

**VOICEOVER:**
"Use these filters to find empty locations when receiving new inventory, or to locate specific products quickly. This is especially helpful during physical inventory counts."

---

## Part 3: Generating Pick Sheets (3 minutes)

**[SCREEN: Navigate to Warehouse > Pick Sheets]**

**VOICEOVER:**
"Now let's create a pick sheet. Click Warehouse, then Pick Sheets, then Generate New Pick Sheet."

**[SCREEN: Show order selection screen]**

**VOICEOVER:**
"Pick sheets are generated from orders with READY status. These are orders that have been approved and are ready to be picked from the warehouse. Let's select these five orders for today's afternoon deliveries."

**[SCREEN: Check 5 order boxes]**

**VOICEOVER:**
"You can filter by delivery date, customer, or priority. Today we're picking orders for tomorrow's deliveries. Click the checkboxes next to each order you want to include."

**[SCREEN: Show summary: 5 orders, 28 items, 95 bottles]**

**VOICEOVER:**
"The summary shows we're picking 5 orders totaling 28 line items and 95 bottles. Leora estimates this will take about 20 minutes to pick. Let's generate the pick sheet."

**[SCREEN: Click Generate Pick Sheet, show generated sheet]**

**VOICEOVER:**
"Here's our pick sheet! Notice the items are sorted by location. The pick order starts at A-1-Bottom and progresses through the warehouse efficiently. This minimizes backtracking and speeds up picking."

**[SCREEN: Highlight pick order column]**

**VOICEOVER:**
"The pick order column shows the optimized sequence. Item 1 is at A-1-Bottom, Item 2 is at A-1-Middle, Item 3 is at A-3-Bottom. We're picking everything in Aisle A before moving to Aisle B. This is much faster than picking in order-by-order sequence."

**[SCREEN: Show PDF export button]**

**VOICEOVER:**
"You can export this pick sheet as a PDF for printing, or use it on an iPad as we'll show next. The status is currently READY, which means it's queued for picking."

---

## Part 4: Picking Workflow (iPad Demo) (4 minutes)

**[SWITCH TO: On-location warehouse footage with iPad]**

**VOICEOVER:**
"Now let's see how to actually pick orders using an iPad. I'm standing in our warehouse with an iPad open to the pick sheet we just generated."

**[SCREEN: iPad showing pick sheet, tap Start Picking]**

**VOICEOVER:**
"First, tap Start Picking. This changes the status to PICKING and starts tracking how long the pick takes."

**[SCREEN: Walking to Aisle A, camera shows signage]**

**VOICEOVER:**
"The first item is at A-1-Bottom. I'm walking to Aisle A. Our aisles are clearly labeled with large signs, and rows are numbered sequentially from front to back."

**[SCREEN: Show product at A-1-Bottom location]**

**VOICEOVER:**
"Here's location A-1-Bottom. The shelf label matches the system. We have Burgundy Chardonnay here, SKU CHARD-001. The pick sheet says I need 6 bottles for Wine Bar XYZ."

**[SCREEN: Pick 6 bottles, place in labeled bin]**

**VOICEOVER:**
"I count 6 bottles and place them in the bin labeled with the customer name. Each order has its own bin to keep items separated."

**[SCREEN: Tap checkbox on iPad]**

**VOICEOVER:**
"Now I tap the checkbox on the iPad to mark this item as picked. The item grays out, and the system highlights the next item automatically."

**[SCREEN: Move to A-1-Middle]**

**VOICEOVER:**
"Next item is A-1-Middle, just above where I was. I'm picking from top to bottom on this shelf before moving to the next row. This is efficient – no wasted movement."

**[SCREEN: Continue picking, show speed]**

**VOICEOVER:**
"I continue through the pick sheet. Notice how I'm not jumping back and forth across the warehouse. Every item is close to the previous one. This is the power of optimized pick order."

**[SCREEN: Demonstrate barcode scanner (optional)]**

**VOICEOVER:**
"If you have a barcode scanner, you can scan the SKU to verify you're picking the right product. The system will alert you if there's a mismatch. This reduces picking errors to near zero."

**[SCREEN: Finish last item, tap Complete Pick Sheet]**

**VOICEOVER:**
"When all items are checked off, I tap Complete Pick Sheet. The system records the completion time – 18 minutes, even faster than estimated! The orders now move to PICKED status and are ready for packing and delivery."

## Part 5: Exporting Routes to Azuga (2 minutes)

**[SWITCH BACK TO: Screen recording]**

**SCREEN: Navigate to Routing > Export to Azuga]**

**VOICEOVER:**
"Now that we've picked our orders, let's optimize the delivery route. Click Routing, then Export to Azuga."

**[SCREEN: Select picked orders, set delivery date to tomorrow]**

**VOICEOVER:**
"Select the orders we just picked, and set the delivery date to tomorrow. Leora will export these to Azuga's route optimization software."

**[SCREEN: Click Generate Azuga CSV, download file]**

**VOICEOVER:**
"Click Generate Azuga CSV and download the file. This CSV contains all the customer addresses, delivery time windows, and order details Azuga needs."

**[SCREEN: Show Azuga platform (if available), or describe process]**

**VOICEOVER:**
"You'll upload this file to Azuga, which will optimize the delivery route considering traffic, distance, and time windows. Azuga creates the most efficient route and tells you which orders to deliver in which sequence."

**[SCREEN: Show import route option in Leora]**

**VOICEOVER:**
"After Azuga optimizes the route, you export a CSV from Azuga and import it back into Leora. Leora creates delivery routes, assigns drivers, and tracks deliveries in real-time. We'll cover this in detail in our Routing & Delivery training video."

## Part 6: Viewing Delivery Routes (2 minutes)

**[SCREEN: Navigate to Routes > Today's Routes]**

**VOICEOVER:**
"Let's look at today's delivery routes. Click Routes, then Today's Routes."

**[SCREEN: Show route list with 3 routes]**

**VOICEOVER:**
"Here we see three routes for today. Route 1 has 9 stops and is assigned to driver John Doe. His status is IN_PROGRESS, meaning he's currently out delivering. We can see he's completed 3 out of 9 stops so far."

**[SCREEN: Click Route 1 to open details]**

**VOICEOVER:**
"Clicking the route shows details: the list of stops in optimized order, estimated arrival times, and the route map. The blue line shows the route path, and the blue dot is John's current location. Customers can track their delivery in real-time and see estimated arrival."

**[SCREEN: Show customer view (if available)]**

**VOICEOVER:**
"Customers receive a tracking link showing the driver's location and estimated arrival time. This reduces 'where's my order' calls and improves customer satisfaction."

## Part 7: Best Practices & Tips (2 minutes)

**[SCREEN: Split screen showing good vs bad organization]**

**VOICEOVER:**
"Let's review some best practices for warehouse organization.

**First: Put fast-moving products near the entrance.** Assign your top 20% of products to A-aisles and bottom shelves. This minimizes walking for products you pick most often.

**Second: Group similar products together.** Keep all Chardonnays together, all Cabernets together. This makes receiving easier and helps pickers learn where things are.

**Third: Keep heavy items on bottom shelves.** Safety first – bottles heavier than 1.5 liters should never go on top shelves. Lightweight items like accessories and small formats go on top.

**Fourth: Update locations immediately when products move.** If you relocate inventory, update the system right away. Accurate locations are critical for efficient picking.

**Fifth: Conduct regular cycle counts.** Count 10% of your locations each week. This catches any discrepancies before they cause problems."

**[SCREEN: Show metrics dashboard]**

**VOICEOVER:**
"Monitor your warehouse metrics regularly. Leora tracks:
- Average pick time per order
- Pick accuracy rate
- Items per hour per picker
- Location utilization percentage

Use these metrics to identify improvement opportunities and recognize top performers."
