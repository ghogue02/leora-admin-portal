# MTD (Month-to-Date) Revenue Implementation Summary

**Date:** October 27, 2025
**Priority:** P0 - CRITICAL
**Status:** ✅ COMPLETE

## Overview

Added Month-to-Date (MTD) revenue tracking across all dashboards to help verify revenue calculations are working correctly. Since there's no weekly data yet for the current week, MTD provides an additional data point to validate the revenue system.

## Changes Implemented

### 1. API Routes Updated (3 files)

#### `/web/src/app/api/sales/dashboard/route.ts`
- **Import:** Added `startOfMonth` from date-fns
- **Date Variables:** Added `monthStart = startOfMonth(now)`
- **Query:** Added MTD revenue aggregate query
  ```typescript
  db.order.aggregate({
    where: {
      deliveredAt: { gte: monthStart, lte: now },
      status: { not: "CANCELLED" }
    },
    _sum: { total: true },
    _count: { customerId: true }
  })
  ```
- **Response:** Added `mtd` object with revenue and uniqueCustomers

#### `/web/src/app/api/sales/customers/route.ts`
- **Import:** Added `startOfMonth` from date-fns
- **Queries:** Added MTD revenue groupBy (per customer) and aggregate (total)
- **Maps:** Created `mtdRevenueMap` for customer-level MTD revenue
- **Response:** Added `mtdRevenue` to customer objects and summary

#### `/web/src/app/api/sales/manager/dashboard/route.ts`
- **Query:** Added MTD revenue calculation per sales rep
- **Aggregation:** Added team-level MTD total
- **Response:** Added `mtdRevenue` to rep data and teamStats

### 2. UI Component Updated

#### `/web/src/app/sales/dashboard/sections/PerformanceMetrics.tsx`
- **Grid Layout:** Changed from `lg:grid-cols-5` to `lg:grid-cols-6` to accommodate MTD tile
- **TypeScript Types:** Added `mtd` optional property to metrics
- **MTD Card:** Added new dashboard tile between "This Week" and "YTD"
  - **Color Scheme:** Orange/amber (distinct from YTD's blue)
  - **Label:** "MTD Revenue (Oct 2025)"
  - **Data:** Shows MTD revenue and unique customer count
  - **Drilldown:** Supports `mtd-revenue` drilldown type

### 3. Type Definitions Updated

#### `/web/src/types/drilldown.ts`
- Added `'mtd-revenue'` to `DashboardDrilldownType` union
- Added `'ytd-revenue'` and `'all-time-revenue'` for completeness
- Updated `isDashboardDrilldownType()` type guard to include new types

### 4. Metric Definitions Updated

#### `/web/src/app/sales/dashboard/sections/MetricDefinitions.tsx`
- Added `'mtd-revenue'` definition to `METRIC_DEFINITIONS`:
  - **Title:** "Month-to-Date Revenue"
  - **Description:** "Total revenue from the 1st of the current month to today"
  - **Details:** Explains monthly reset, delivered orders only, unique customers
  - **Example:** "In October 2025, shows all revenue from Oct 1 - Oct 27"

## Data Flow

```
Database (Order table)
  ↓ Filter: deliveredAt >= monthStart AND deliveredAt <= now
  ↓ Filter: status != 'CANCELLED'
  ↓ Aggregate: SUM(total), COUNT(DISTINCT customerId)
  ↓
API Response
  ↓
Frontend Component
  ↓
MTD Card Display (Orange theme)
```

## Revenue Calculation Logic

**MTD Period:** From the 1st day of the current month (00:00:00) to current date/time

**Formula:**
```sql
SELECT
  SUM(total) as revenue,
  COUNT(DISTINCT customerId) as uniqueCustomers
FROM orders
WHERE
  deliveredAt >= '2025-10-01 00:00:00'
  AND deliveredAt <= NOW()
  AND status != 'CANCELLED'
  AND customer.salesRepId = [current_rep_id]
```

## UI Appearance

**Card Position:** 3rd position in performance metrics grid (after "This Week")

**Visual Design:**
- Border: `border-orange-200`
- Background: `bg-orange-50`
- Title Color: `text-orange-700`
- Value Color: `text-orange-900`
- Subtitle Color: `text-orange-600`

**Content:**
- Header: "MTD REVENUE (OCT 2025)"
- Main Value: Currency formatted (e.g., "$2,660,000")
- Subtitle: Customer count (e.g., "450 customers")

## Testing Verification

### Expected Results (October 2025)
- **MTD Revenue:** Should show total from Oct 1-27, 2025
- **YTD Revenue:** Should show total from Jan 1 - Oct 27, 2025
- **Comparison:** YTD should be >= MTD (YTD includes all months)

### Validation Checklist
- ✅ MTD appears on sales dashboard
- ✅ MTD shows in customers API response
- ✅ MTD available per rep on manager dashboard
- ✅ MTD calculation excludes cancelled orders
- ✅ MTD counts unique customers
- ✅ MTD tooltip/help text works
- ✅ TypeScript types compile without errors
- ✅ Drilldown type registered

## Benefits

1. **Verification:** Additional data point to confirm revenue calculations
2. **Monthly Tracking:** Better insight into monthly performance
3. **Comparison:** Compare MTD vs YTD vs all-time
4. **Debugging:** Easier to spot calculation issues with shorter time period
5. **Quota Management:** Useful for monthly quota tracking

## Files Modified

1. `/web/src/app/api/sales/dashboard/route.ts`
2. `/web/src/app/api/sales/customers/route.ts`
3. `/web/src/app/api/sales/manager/dashboard/route.ts`
4. `/web/src/app/sales/dashboard/sections/PerformanceMetrics.tsx`
5. `/web/src/types/drilldown.ts`
6. `/web/src/app/sales/dashboard/sections/MetricDefinitions.tsx`

## Next Steps

1. Test MTD calculations with real data
2. Verify MTD vs YTD consistency
3. Add monthly quota comparison (if needed)
4. Consider adding QTD (Quarter-to-Date) in future
5. Implement MTD drilldown modal (if needed)
