## Deployment Instructions

### Pre-Deployment
```bash
# 1. Verify TypeScript compiles (ignore unrelated errors)
npx tsc --noEmit

# 2. Run verification script
npx tsx scripts/verify-revenue-fix.ts

# 3. Start dev server for manual testing
npm run dev

# 4. Test all three dashboards
# - Sales rep dashboard
# - Customer list
# - Manager dashboard
```

### Deployment
```bash
# No migrations needed - API changes only
npm run build
npm run start

# Or deploy to production as normal
git add .
git commit -m "fix: Display all-time revenue instead of filtered revenue showing $0"
git push origin main
```

### Post-Deployment
1. Monitor API response times
2. Check error logs for any issues
3. Verify revenue displays correctly in production
4. Gather user feedback

---

## Rollback Plan

If issues occur:

```bash
# Revert the changes
git revert HEAD

# Rebuild and redeploy
npm run build
npm run start
```

**Safe to rollback:** No database migrations, no data changes, only API/UI updates.
