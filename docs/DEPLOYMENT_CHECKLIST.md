## Performance Testing

### Lighthouse Scores:
Run on `/admin` and `/sales/customers`:

- [ ] Performance: >80
- [ ] Accessibility: >95
- [ ] Best Practices: >90
- [ ] SEO: >90

### Bundle Size:
```bash
npm run build
# Check .next/static/chunks for size
```

**Expected:**
- Breadcrumbs component: ~2KB gzipped
- No significant increase in total bundle size

---

## Rollback Plan

### If Critical Issues Found:

**Quick Rollback (UI only):**
```bash
git revert HEAD
npm run build
# Deploy
```

**Selective Rollback:**

1. **Breadcrumbs only:**
   ```typescript
   // In /web/src/app/sales/layout.tsx
   // Comment out lines 9, 22-26
   ```

2. **Recent Activity only:**
   ```bash
   # Delete /web/src/app/api/admin/audit-logs/recent/route.ts
   # Revert /web/src/app/admin/page.tsx
   ```

3. **User Accounts link only:**
   ```typescript
   // In /web/src/app/admin/page.tsx line 180
   href="/admin/users"  // Restore (though this restores the bug)
   ```
