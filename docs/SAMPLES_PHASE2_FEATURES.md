## Integration Points

### Email Service Integration
To enable automated emails, integrate with your email provider in:
`/src/app/sales/samples/lib/email-service.ts`

Example with SendGrid:
```typescript
import sgMail from '@sendgrid/mail';

async function sendEmail(config: EmailConfig) {
  sgMail.setApiKey(process.env.SENDGRID_API_KEY!);
  await sgMail.send({
    from: config.from,
    to: config.to,
    subject: config.subject,
    text: config.text,
    html: config.html,
  });
  return true;
}
```

### Scheduled Jobs
For automated follow-up task creation, schedule the endpoint:
```typescript
// With cron or scheduler
POST /api/sales/samples/auto-follow-up
// Run daily or weekly
```
