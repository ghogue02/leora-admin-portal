### Quality Verification

**Before (Generic):**
> "Dark cherry, blackberry, vanilla oak, hints of tobacco, leather..."
> Used by 8 different wines ❌

**After (Specific - Sailor Seeks Horse Pinot Noir 2022):**
> "The nose displays wild, perfumed edges with complex layers of sweet herbs, game meats, and turned earth. Bright raspberry and bramble notes intertwine with unexpected elements of orange peel, roast chestnuts, and souk-like spices..."
> Unique to this wine ✅

## 📋 Step-by-Step Process for Full Catalog (1,879 Wines)

### Phase 1: Preparation (1 hour)

1. **Generate Research Tasks**
   ```bash
   # Create task files for all 1,879 wines in batches of 50
   npx tsx scripts/enrich-wines-with-agents.ts 1879 0
   ```

   This creates ~38 batch files:
   - `data/wine-research-batch-1.json` (wines 1-50)
   - `data/wine-research-batch-2.json` (wines 51-100)
   - ...
   - `data/wine-research-batch-38.json` (wines 1851-1879)

### Phase 2: Research (Parallel Processing Recommended)

**Option A: Sequential (Safe, Slow)**
Process one batch at a time using Claude Code's Task tool:

```typescript
// For each batch (1-38):
Task("Wine Researcher", `
Research the 50 wines in /data/wine-research-batch-N.json

For EACH wine:
1. WebFetch search: "{wine name} {vintage} wine tasting notes"
2. Find professional reviews (Wine Spectator, Wine Enthusiast, etc.)
3. Extract ACCURATE information
4. Create UNIQUE tasting notes

Save results to: /data/wine-research-results-batch-N.json
`, "researcher")
```

**Time:** ~38 batches × 30 min/batch = ~19 hours

**Option B: Parallel (Faster)**
Run 3-5 researcher agents concurrently:

```typescript
[Single Message - 3 Concurrent Agents]:
  Task("Wine Researcher 1", "Research batch 1-10...", "researcher")
  Task("Wine Researcher 2", "Research batch 11-20...", "researcher")
  Task("Wine Researcher 3", "Research batch 21-30...", "researcher")
```

**Time:** ~6-8 hours (with 3 concurrent agents)

### Phase 3: Apply to Database

After each batch is researched:

```bash
# Apply batch 1
npx tsx scripts/apply-enrichment-results.ts 1

# Apply batch 2
npx tsx scripts/apply-enrichment-results.ts 2

# ... etc
```

Or create a loop script:
```bash
for i in {1..38}; do
  npx tsx scripts/apply-enrichment-results.ts $i
  sleep 2
done
```

### Phase 4: Validation

Run uniqueness check after completion:
```bash
npx tsx scripts/check-unique-notes.ts
```

Expected results:
- ✅ 1,800+ unique aroma descriptions
- ✅ 85-95% average confidence scores
- ✅ No duplicate tasting notes

## 🎯 Quality Assurance

### Validation Checklist

After enrichment, verify:

- [ ] All products have `enrichedBy: 'claude-code-accurate-v2'`
- [ ] Confidence scores average 85%+
- [ ] No duplicate aroma descriptions
- [ ] All tasting notes are 3-4 sentences minimum
- [ ] Food pairings are specific (not generic)
- [ ] Serving info matches wine style
- [ ] Region/varietal data is accurate

### Sample Quality Check

```sql
-- Check enrichment status
SELECT
  COUNT(*) as total,
  COUNT(CASE WHEN "enrichedBy" LIKE '%accurate%' THEN 1 END) as accurate,
  AVG(CAST("enrichedBy" AS TEXT) LIKE '%conf:%' AS FLOAT) as avg_confidence
FROM "Product";

-- Find any remaining duplicates
SELECT
  "tastingNotes"->>'aroma' as aroma,
  COUNT(*) as count
FROM "Product"
WHERE "tastingNotes" IS NOT NULL
GROUP BY "tastingNotes"->>'aroma'
HAVING COUNT(*) > 1
ORDER BY count DESC;
```

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Issue:** Product name mismatch
**Solution:** Update product name in database or manually match in script

**Issue:** Low confidence score (<70%)
**Solution:** Re-research with more specific search terms

**Issue:** Generic-sounding notes
**Solution:** Agent needs more specific instructions; regenerate

**Issue:** Duplicate aromas appearing
**Solution:** Run check-unique-notes.ts, identify duplicates, regenerate those wines
