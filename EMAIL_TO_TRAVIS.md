## 🗣️ Next Steps - I Need Your Input

Now that you can see all your data in one place, I'd love to hear:

**1. What's missing?**
   - Are there reports or views you wish you had?
   - What questions do you want the system to answer that it doesn't right now?

**2. What needs to change?**
   - Are customers organized the way you want?
   - Do the sales territories make sense?
   - Are there fields missing (like customer notes, special pricing, etc.)?

**3. What data do you have?**
   - Customer emails (so we can enable notifications)
   - Historical order data we should import?
   - Product information that's missing?
   - Anything in spreadsheets that should be in the system?

**4. What's your priority?**
   - Which feature would make the biggest impact on your business right now?
   - What task takes you the most time that we could automate?
