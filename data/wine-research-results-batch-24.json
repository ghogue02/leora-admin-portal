      "description": "An elegant Cabernet Franc from the 2019 vintage that showcases the variety's characteristic finesse and aromatic complexity. This wine offers a lighter, more refined alternative to Cabernet Sauvignon with bright red fruit, subtle herbaceous notes, and the smooth tannin structure that defines quality Cabernet Franc.",
      "tastingNotes": {
        "aroma": "The bouquet opens with vibrant aromas of raspberry and red currant, hallmarks of well-made Cabernet Franc. Blackcurrant and violet notes add depth and floral elegance, while the variety's distinctive herbaceous character emerges with subtle hints of green bell pepper and fresh tobacco leaf. These vegetal notes provide complexity without dominating the fruit expression. Secondary aromas of graphite and cedar suggest quality oak aging, while hints of rose petals and dried herbs add refinement and lift to the aromatic profile.",
        "palate": "Medium-bodied with the smooth, refined tannin structure that distinguishes Cabernet Franc from its Cabernet Sauvignon cousin. The palate reveals bright flavors of raspberry, red cherry, and strawberry with excellent freshness and purity. Subtle blackcurrant notes add depth while maintaining the wine's elegant, fruit-forward character. The characteristic green, vegetal strike is present but balanced—adding interest and complexity without overwhelming the fruit. Integrated oak influence contributes subtle spice and structure. The wine's balanced acidity and moderate alcohol create a harmonious, food-friendly profile.",
        "finish": "The finish is smooth and moderately persistent with lingering red fruit and subtle herbal notes. The variety's slightly lighter tannin structure ensures a refined, elegant conclusion. Hints of violet and graphite emerge on the aftertaste, adding complexity and interest."
