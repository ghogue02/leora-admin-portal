Hints of white peach and melon add subtle complexity.",
        "palate": "Light to medium-bodied with a refreshing, crisp texture that makes this rosé highly drinkable and versatile. The fruit flavors are fresh and vibrant—wild strawberry, watermelon, and cherry—supported by bright acidity that keeps everything lively. A touch of citrus—grapefruit and lime—adds zing without creating harshness. The wine shows good balance between fruit, acidity, and a whisper of residual sweetness that doesn't make it sweet but adds roundness. The mouthfeel is clean and slightly mineral, with a delicate structure that works well as an aperitif or with food.",
        "finish": "Clean and refreshing with lingering red berry and citrus notes. The acidity maintains presence through the finish, leaving the palate refreshed and ready for another sip. Subtle mineral and floral notes persist, adding elegance to this crowd-pleasing style."
