The unfiltered nature contributes to a fuller mouthfeel and more complex flavor profile. Small-batch production ensures attention to detail and quality throughout.",
        "finish": "The finish is bone dry and refreshing, with lingering notes of white tea and subtle apple character. Clean and crisp, the wine concludes with sophisticated herbal notes and persistent natural carbonation that cleanses the palate."
