The texture is crisp and clean, with flavors of green apple, citrus zest, and white stone fruits dancing across the tongue.

      "description": "Perucchi has been crafted in Catalonia, Spain since 1886 following the original recipe of Augustus Perucchi. This Gran Reserva is the official vermouth provider to the Spanish Royal Family, distinguished by its use of over 50 natural botanicals and a unique soleras aging system dating back to 1876.",
      "tastingNotes": {
        "aroma": "The nose is complex and inviting with characteristic vermouth aromatics showcasing dry wood, bitter herbs, and sweet spices. Macerated cherry and dried fruit notes mingle with distinctive botanical elements including liquorice, black pepper, clove, and gentian root. The Gran Reserva shows additional depth from aging in old brandy barrels with notes of caramel, vanilla, and oxidative complexity. There's an herbal quality reminiscent of wormwood, chamomile, and Mediterranean herbs that creates an intriguing aromatic profile both bitter and sweet.",
        "palate": "The palate is balanced and slightly bitter in the classic vermouth style, showing soft richness balanced by herbal complexity and gentle sweetness. Flavors of macerated cherry, raisin, and dried fig are complemented by a complex array of botanical notes including bitter orange peel, gentian, cinchona bark, and aromatic spices. The two years of aging in old brandy barrels adds depth and roundness with subtle notes of caramel, vanilla, and oxidized fruit. At 15% alcohol, the vermouth maintains excellent balance and drinkability. The texture is smooth and silky with good body and persistence.",
        "finish": "The finish is long with lingering bitter herb notes, macerated fruit, and sweet spices. The slightly bitter quality characteristic of quality vermouth persists pleasantly, balanced by subtle sweetness and warming alcohol. The complexity of the 50+ botanicals continues to reveal itself through the extended finish."
