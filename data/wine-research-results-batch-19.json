      "description": "A versatile Merlot packaged in a 20-liter keg format, representing the growing trend toward sustainable, draft wine service in restaurants and venues. This wine offers classic Merlot characteristics with soft tannins and approachable fruit character, designed for fresh, by-the-glass service that minimizes waste and maintains freshness through the keg's pressurized system.",
      "tastingNotes": {
        "aroma": "The nose opens with inviting aromas of ripe plum, black cherry, and red currant, accented by notes of milk chocolate and vanilla from oak influence. Subtle hints of dried herbs—bay leaf and sage—add complexity, while soft floral notes of violet provide aromatic lift. The bouquet shows gentle integration and approachability, with earthy undertones of graphite and forest floor adding depth to the fruit-forward profile.",
        "palate": "Medium to full-bodied with a supple, velvety texture and soft tannins that make this wine immediately accessible and food-friendly. Flavors of dark cherry, blackberry, and plum dominate the palate, supported by notes of mocha, dark chocolate, and subtle toast from oak aging. Mid-palate smoothness is balanced by moderate acidity that provides freshness, while earthy notes of tobacco leaf and leather add complexity. The wine shows classic Merlot charm with its round, generous mouthfeel.",
        "finish": "The finish is medium-length with lingering dark fruit flavors and soft, resolved tannins that leave a pleasant, smooth impression. Subtle notes of cocoa powder and sweet oak spice persist, while a touch of earthiness adds interest. This is an easy-drinking, versatile Merlot designed for enjoyment over the next 2-3 years in its keg format."
