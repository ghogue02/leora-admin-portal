Herbal elements of fennel, fresh herbs, and a hint of anise add complexity and Mediterranean character. Subtle mineral notes of flint and wet stone provide depth, while a touch of almond and white pepper adds intrigue. The aromatic profile is fresh, inviting, and distinctly Italian.",
        "palate": "Medium-bodied with excellent structure and a rich, almost oily texture characteristic of Pecorino. The palate delivers flavors of ripe stone fruits—peach, apricot, and nectarine—balanced by bright citrus notes of lemon and grapefruit. Fresh acidity provides energy and lift, while a distinctive saline minerality adds complexity and a sense of place. Subtle nutty notes and hints of fennel seed contribute to the wine's unique personality. The texture is more substantial than many Italian whites, with a slight glycerol richness that doesn't compromise freshness.",
        "finish": "Long and satisfying, the finish features persistent stone fruit and citrus flavors with pronounced minerality. A subtle almond note and herbal character add complexity, while bright acidity ensures a clean, refreshing conclusion. The wine leaves a slightly saline impression that enhances its food-friendly nature."
