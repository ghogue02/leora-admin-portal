The overall impression is one of balance and drinkability rather than power or concentration.",
        "finish": "The finish is moderate in length with the light berry character fading gracefully. Oak influence is most noticeable on the finish, adding a gentle toasted quality without bitterness. The soft tannins persist just long enough to provide structure, while the overall conclusion is clean and approachable, making this an excellent wine for pairing with a wide range of foods."

        "aroma": "The nose presents classic Prosecco aromatics with fresh green apple and ripe pear leading the way, creating an immediately appealing and accessible bouquet. Delicate white floral notes add elegance and lift, reminiscent of acacia blossoms or white flowers. Citrus hints of lemon zest provide brightness and energy, while the overall aromatic profile emphasizes freshness and vibrancy. The keg format helps preserve these delicate aromatics by protecting the wine from oxygen exposure until service.",
        "palate": "Light-bodied and refreshing with persistent fine bubbles that create a creamy mousse on the palate. The primary fruit flavors mirror the nose, with crisp green apple and pear dominating, supported by subtle citrus notes that add zest. A hint of almond characteristic of quality Prosecco provides subtle complexity, while the overall flavor profile remains clean and focused on freshness. The wine is off-dry with just enough residual sweetness to balance the bright acidity, creating an appealing, crowd-pleasing style. The keg format ensures the wine tastes as fresh with the last pour as the first.",

Light fruit notes fade gracefully without becoming cloying, while the wine's natural acidity provides a crisp conclusion. The off-dry style means the finish is approachable and never austere, making this an excellent choice for aperitivo or celebrations."
