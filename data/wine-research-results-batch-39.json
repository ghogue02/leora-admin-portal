Additional layers include varnish, pipe tobacco, cigar box, and steel-cut oatmeal alongside candied citrus. Polished mahogany aromatics emerge with mushroom, a touch of black tea, and dark chocolate. Coffee candy notes add sweetness to the remarkably preserved aromatic profile.",
        "palate": "Much of the aromatic complexity echoes on the palate, which has the texture of heated honey—rich, viscous, and coating. For all its aromatic maturity and surprising dark brown color, this Port has tremendous vigor on the palate with crisp acidity bringing exceptional balance and life. Flavors include fig, caramel, spice, dark chocolate, and cooked citrus fruit. The wine remains remarkably fresh despite its century-plus age.",
        "finish": "The finish is extraordinarily long and complex, reminiscent of fine aged Cognac. The acidity fills the palate and provides exceptional balance, while the concentrated flavors of dried fruit, coffee, chocolate, and caramel linger seemingly indefinitely. This is a meditation wine that evolves continuously in the glass, revealing new dimensions with each sip."
