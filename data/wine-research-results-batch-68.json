        "palate": "Lithe and elegant with gentle red fruit character that reflects the brief skin contact. The palate is refreshing and light-bodied, focusing on freshness rather than extraction or weight. Nectarine and citrus notes from the white grape blend provide lift and aromatic complexity, while subtle Shiraz fruit offers a delicate red berry backbone. A small portion of firmly pressed Cabernet Franc juice adds structural support without heaviness. The wine is both appealing and food-friendly, designed to be served chilled for maximum refreshment.",
        "finish": "Clean and refreshing with citrus pith and light red fruit persisting. The finish is crisp and lifted, enhanced by the natural acidity from the white grape additions, creating a wine that finishes bright and inviting rather than heavy or extracted."
