      "productName": "Alella Marfil Sec 2017",
      "description": "A distinctive white wine from the historic Alella DO cooperative near Barcelona, carrying the iconic Marfil (Ivory) brand name that has captivated Catalonia since the 1920s. Founded in 1906, Alella Vinícola produces this wine from Pansa Blanca (the local name for Xarel-lo), showcasing the unique terroir of this small Mediterranean coastal wine region just north of Barcelona.",
      "tastingNotes": {
        "aroma": "Delicate and aromatic with notes of white flowers—acacia and orange blossom—characteristic of Pansa Blanca/Xarel-lo. The nose reveals fresh citrus notes of lemon zest and grapefruit, supported by green apple and white peach. Subtle mineral undertones reflect the Mediterranean coastal terroir, while hints of almond and fennel add complexity. The aromatic profile shows freshness despite the wine's age, with a slight oxidative note of blanched almond that adds interest without detracting from the wine's vitality.",
        "palate": "Medium-bodied with crisp acidity that defines Alella whites, though the 2017 vintage shows more texture and depth than younger examples. The palate delivers flavors of citrus—lemon and grapefruit—alongside white orchard fruits and a distinctive saline quality that speaks to the wine's proximity to the Mediterranean Sea. The wine shows characteristic unctuous texture with floral and white fruit flavors, maintaining freshness through good acidity. A note of pleasant bitterness on the mid-palate, typical of Xarel-lo, adds complexity and food-friendliness. The style is notably dry (Sec) with minimal residual sugar, allowing the variety's natural characteristics to express themselves fully.",
        "finish": "Medium-length finish with lingering citrus notes and a characteristic salty minerality that calls for seafood. The wine concludes with refreshing acidity and subtle almond notes, leaving a clean, dry impression. The Mediterranean influence persists through the finish with that distinctive saline quality and hint of sea breeze."
