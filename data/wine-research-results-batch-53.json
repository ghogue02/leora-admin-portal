      "tastingNotes": {
        "aroma": "The nose opens with an intriguing melange of dark cherry, blackcurrant, and plum, interwoven with nuances of cedar, graphite, and dried herbs. Subtle notes of violet and rose petal add floral complexity, while hints of vanilla, cocoa, and sweet oak from barrel aging provide depth. Additional layers reveal black olive tapenade, dried sage, and a whisper of smokiness. The aromatic profile suggests a sophisticated blend of Bordeaux and possibly Rhône varietals, creating multilayered complexity.",
        "palate": "Medium to full-bodied with excellent structure and integrated tannins. The palate showcases dark fruit flavors—blackberry, black plum, and cassis—balanced by earthy notes of graphite, tobacco leaf, and dried Mediterranean herbs. Oak influence is present but judicious, contributing vanilla, baking spice, and a subtle toastiness without overwhelming the fruit. The mid-palate reveals touches of dark chocolate, espresso, and a distinctive savory quality reminiscent of black olive and cured meat. Bright acidity maintains freshness and balance throughout, while the wine's texture is simultaneously plush and structured.",
        "finish": "The finish is long and contemplative, marked by persistent dark fruit, earth, and spice. Firm but refined tannins provide grip and structure, suggesting the wine's aging potential. Echoes of oak, herb, and mineral complexity linger, creating a satisfying and multidimensional conclusion."
