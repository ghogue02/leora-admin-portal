        "aroma": "Fresh and vibrant aromatics showcasing white pears, white currants, and crisp apple. Bright citrus notes of lemon zest emerge alongside fresh herbs, while a pronounced stony, mineral quality evokes wet stones and sea breeze. The nose is clean and invigorating, with the complexity derived from lees aging adding subtle depth beneath the bright fruit.",
        "palate": "Deliciously creamy mouthfeel, a hallmark of sur lie aging, full of citrus and apple flavors with stony, mineral notes taking center stage. The wine shows excellent freshness and minerality throughout, with a salty tang that speaks to its coastal terroir. Despite the creamy texture, the wine maintains vibrant acidity that keeps it lively and refreshing. The flavor profile is pristine and focused, emphasizing mineral expression over overt fruit.",
        "finish": "Clean and mineral-driven finish with lingering citrus notes and pronounced stoniness. The saline quality persists through the end, leaving the palate refreshed and ready for food. The finish is crisp and energizing, characteristic of well-made Muscadet."
