    "productName": "Libertine \"You Are Still Alive\" Pet-Nat 2022",
    "description": "A vibrant pétillant naturel from Oregon's Willamette Valley, crafted using the ancestral method with native vineyard yeasts and minimal intervention. This natural sparkling wine showcases the pure expression of its terroir through fermentation in neutral oak barrels with no additives except a minimal amount of sulfite.",
    "tastingNotes": {
      "aroma": "The nose opens with lively effervescence releasing fresh orchard fruits—green apple and Asian pear—intermingled with white flowers and a subtle bread dough character from extended lees contact. Delicate notes of citrus zest and raw almonds add complexity, while a mineral undertone hints at the volcanic soils of the Willamette Valley. The aromatic profile is clean yet expressive, balancing wild fermentation character with bright fruit purity.",
      "palate": "On the palate, fine, persistent bubbles create a creamy mousse that carries flavors of crisp green apple, Meyer lemon, and white peach. The wine shows remarkable tension between its fruity sweetness and zippy acidity, with a slightly saline quality adding depth. Mid-palate weight comes from extended lees aging, offering a subtle yeasty richness without heaviness. The neutral oak barrel fermentation provides texture rather than oak flavor, allowing the fruit and natural wine character to shine through.",
      "finish": "The finish is refreshingly crisp with lingering citrus notes and a clean mineral edge. A gentle effervescence persists, leaving the palate energized and ready for another sip. The conclusion is dry yet fruit-forward, with subtle phenolic grip providing structure to this fun, unconventional sparkling wine."

      "palate": "On the palate, this wine displays tremendous structure and a viscous, almost glycerin-like texture that coats the mouth luxuriously. The dual-vintage vinification creates exceptional complexity—the older vintage providing depth, oak integration, and evolved flavors, while the younger vintage contributes vibrant acidity and fresh fruit character. Abundant aromas of flowers and fruits translate to flavors of citrus, stone fruit, and subtle tropical notes (pineapple, mango).

Delicate floral notes of jasmine, violet, and rose petal add aromatic complexity and elegance. The cool maritime influence from nearby False Bay contributes a subtle salinity and freshness, while the old bush vines provide depth and concentration. Hints of white pepper, dried herbs, and subtle earthy notes add savory complexity without detracting from the wine's primary fruit character.",

    "productName": "Emek Reb Yose Ben Teima Cabernet Sauvignon Mevushal (MD & DC)",
    "description": "A kosher Cabernet Sauvignon from Israel's prestigious Galilee region, produced under strict religious supervision (Mevushal, Kosher for Passover, OU and Badatz Jerusalem Edah Hachareidis certified). The Mevushal process—heating the wine to specific temperatures—ensures the wine maintains its kosher status while preserving quality and character, allowing it to be handled and served by anyone without compromising religious observance.",
    "tastingNotes": {
      "aroma": "The nose presents classic Cabernet Sauvignon hallmarks with a Mediterranean twist reflective of Galilee's warm climate. Aromas of ripe blackberry, cassis, and black plum dominate, supported by notes of cedar, tobacco leaf, and dried herbs characteristic of the region. Subtle hints of dark chocolate, espresso, and vanilla from oak aging add complexity, while a suggestion of eucalyptus and Mediterranean scrubland brings regional character. The aromatic profile shows the ripeness possible in Israel's sunny climate while maintaining varietal typicity.",
      "palate": "On the palate, this Cabernet delivers full-bodied richness with concentrated dark fruit flavors—blackcurrant, black cherry, and plum—that reflect Galilee's warm, sun-drenched growing conditions. The wine shows good structure with firm but ripe tannins that provide grip without harshness, a testament to careful winemaking that maintains quality through the Mevushal heating process. Oak influence contributes notes of vanilla, mocha, and subtle baking spices, while maintaining fruit focus. Medium to high acidity provides balance to the wine's richness, keeping it food-friendly and structured. The Mevushal process, when done carefully, preserves the wine's core character while ensuring religious compliance.",
      "finish": "The finish shows good length with persistent dark fruit, oak spice, and moderate tannins. The conclusion is clean and structured, with the wine's acidity and tannins providing framework for food pairing. While the Mevushal process can sometimes soften a wine's structure, careful production maintains this Cabernet's integrity and varietal character."
