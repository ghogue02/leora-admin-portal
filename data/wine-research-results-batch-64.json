The wine presents a harmonious integration of fruit, oak, and terroir-driven elements.",
        "palate": "Good acidity greets the entry, providing freshness and lift to the ripe fruit core. Sweet tannins coat the palate with a pleasant, approachable texture that makes the wine immediately enjoyable despite its structure. The wine is well-structured with good volume and body, showcasing the concentration that old vines naturally provide. Ripe red and black fruit flavors dominate, complemented by vanilla, spices, and subtle toffee notes from oak aging. The calcareous clay terroir adds complexity and prevents the wine from becoming overly sweet or heavy.",
        "finish": "A sweet aftertaste lingers with persistent notes of ripe fruit, vanilla, and spice. The good structure ensures a long, satisfying finish that balances sweetness with refreshing acidity and fine tannins."

The capsaicin provides a gentle warming sensation on the palate that mimics the heat of alcohol without any harshness. The drink maintains impressive complexity and depth for a non-alcoholic offering.",
