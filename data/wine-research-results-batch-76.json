Notes of coconut and light vanilla suggest subtle oak influence that enhances rather than dominates.",
        "finish": "The finish is long and fruit-forward, with tropical and citrus notes persisting gracefully. The wine's natural acidity keeps the palate refreshed, while the spicy quality returns on the tail, adding a final layer of complexity. A hint of white pepper and stone fruit lingers, making this a thoroughly enjoyable and food-friendly wine."

      "productName": "Dominique Portet Sauvignon Blanc 2022",
      "description": "A Bordeaux-influenced Sauvignon Blanc from Australia's prestigious Yarra Valley, crafted by ninth-generation winemaker Dominique Portet. This was the first wine released under the Dominique Portet label in 2000 and represents a distinctive approach to the variety, employing barrel fermentation with lees stirring to create complexity and texture reminiscent of white Bordeaux. Executive winemaker Ben Portet continues his father's legacy of producing elegant, food-friendly wines.",
      "tastingNotes": {
        "aroma": "The nose presents a sophisticated blend of citrus and white stone fruits, particularly lemon, lime, and white peach, that provide the aromatic foundation. White blossom and delicate floral notes add elegance and lift, while subtle hints of dry grass and fresh herbs reflect classic Sauvignon Blanc character. What distinguishes this wine is the presence of honeycomb and subtle gunflint notes from barrel fermentation and lees contact, adding layers of complexity beyond typical varietal expression. Light toasty nuances emerge as the wine opens, speaking to the Bordeaux-influenced winemaking approach. The aromatic profile is refined and integrated, balancing fruit purity with textural complexity.",
        "palate": "The palate reveals exceptional structure and roundness unusual for Sauvignon Blanc, with the barrel fermentation and lees stirring creating a creamy, delicate mouthfeel that sets this wine apart. Citrus and stone fruit flavors dominate—particularly white peach, lemon, and lime—supported by bright natural acidity that provides framework and energy. The texture is notably creamy and textural, with subtle weight and body that make this wine more substantial than typical Sauvignon Blanc. Honeycomb and light mineral notes add complexity, while the oak influence remains perfectly integrated, enhancing rather than masking the varietal character. This is a wine that emphasizes elegance, balance, and food compatibility over overt fruit or herbaceous character.",
        "finish": "Long and refined, with persistent citrus notes and a distinctive mineral quality. The creamy texture continues through the finish, with honeycomb and stone fruit flavors lingering gracefully. The wine's bright acidity ensures a fresh, clean conclusion while the barrel influence adds length and sophistication. A subtle flinty quality returns on the tail, adding a final layer of complexity."
