        "aroma": "The bouquet is a masterclass in aged Rioja character: tertiary aromas dominate with leather, tobacco leaf, dried mushroom, and forest floor creating an earthy, savory foundation. Evolved fruit shows as dried cherry, fig, and prune, while background notes of vanilla, cedar, and cigar box reveal extensive oak aging. Subtle hints of balsamic, truffle, and autumn leaves add depth, and delicate floral notes of dried rose petal provide unexpected lift. The aromatics are complex, integrated, and distinctly Old World in style.",
        "palate": "The palate delivers silky elegance with perfectly integrated components. Red fruit has evolved into dried cherry, cranberry, and red currant character, accented by notes of orange peel and pomegranate. The wine's medium body feels weightless yet substantial, supported by fine-grained tannins that have mellowed to velvet softness. Savory elements dominate the flavor profile: leather, tobacco, earth, and umami-rich mushroom notes create complexity, while extended oak aging manifests as vanilla, coconut, and subtle smoke. The balance between fruit, acidity, and tertiary development is exquisite.",
        "finish": "The finish is remarkably long and refined, with dried fruit, spice, and earthy notes persisting elegantly. Soft tannins provide gentle structure, while bright acidity keeps the wine fresh despite its age. Lingering notes of tobacco, leather, and dried cherry fade slowly, leaving a satisfying, contemplative conclusion."
