        "palate": "Medium-bodied with a delightful bittersweet character that balances orange sweetness against the bitter notes of gentian root and wormwood. Deep plum and cassis flavors emerge alongside the citrus, while fruitcake spices and vanilla provide warmth and richness. The wine base contributes subtle grape and berry flavors, while a touch of acidity prevents the sweetness from becoming cloying. Over ice, a pleasant tartness emerges that subdues some of the sweetness and highlights the herbal complexity. The texture is round and smooth with excellent balance.",
        "finish": "The finish is moderately long with lingering bitter-orange notes and gentle spice. The characteristic vermouth bitterness provides a clean, refreshing conclusion that stimulates the appetite and invites another sip or the next course."
