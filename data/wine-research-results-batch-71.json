Hints of dark bread crust, toffee, and gentle spice (clove and subtle pepper) add complexity, while a whisper of chocolate and toasted nuts emerges in the background. The yeast character is present but restrained, allowing malt complexity to shine.",
        "palate": "Balanced and subtle, the palate delivers malt-forward sweetness with ripe dark fruit flavors—think dried plum, raisin, and black cherry—harmoniously integrated with caramel and toffee notes. The Belgian yeast contributes gentle fruity esters without overwhelming phenolic spice, creating a smooth, approachable drinking experience. Medium body with moderate carbonation provides pleasant texture, while subtle hop bitterness balances the malt sweetness. The beer drinks clean and smooth, making it very enjoyable and a house favorite for good reason.",
        "finish": "Gentle fruit and malt flavors persist on the moderately dry finish, with subtle spice notes and a hint of warming alcohol that never becomes hot or harsh. The 6.3% ABV is perfectly integrated."
