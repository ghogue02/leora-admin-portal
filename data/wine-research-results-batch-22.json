The Syrah provides a spicy backbone with black pepper and dark berry notes, while Grenache adds red fruit brightness and aromatic lift. Petit Verdot contributes structure and floral notes, with both Cabernets and Merlot rounding out the blend with classic dark fruit and subtle herbal complexity. The 18 months in second, third, and fourth fill barrels have integrated beautifully, adding texture and subtle spice without oak dominance. The tannins are well-rounded and supple, providing structure while maintaining approachability.",
        "finish": "The finish is long, delicious, and satisfying with persistent dark fruit and spice notes. Well-rounded tannins provide gentle grip while the wine's natural freshness keeps everything lively and balanced. Subtle hints of dark chocolate, espresso, and Mediterranean herbs linger, inviting another sip. This is a wine that over-delivers on quality and drinking pleasure."
