        "aroma": "The nose presents a captivating array of red fruit aromas, featuring bright cherry, fresh raspberry, and wild strawberry alongside floral notes of rose petal and violet. Subtle earthy elements of mushroom, forest floor, and wet stone add depth and intrigue. Delicate spice notes of cinnamon and white pepper emerge with air, along with hints of cranberry and pomegranate. The aromatics display the purity and precision characteristic of well-made cool-climate Pinot Noir, with beautiful clarity and intensity.",
        "palate": "On the palate, the wine reveals medium body with silky tannins and vibrant acidity that energizes the fruit. Flavors of tart cherry, red currant, and raspberry are complemented by notes of rhubarb, black tea, and subtle oak-derived spice. The texture is refined and elegant, with a core of minerality that adds tension and complexity. The wine's balance is exemplary, with fruit intensity matched by structural elements that provide both immediate appeal and aging potential. Savory undertones of dried herbs and earth add complexity without overwhelming the delicate fruit character.",

Subtle spice and floral notes linger elegantly, while the wine's fresh acidity provides lift and ensures a clean conclusion.
