        "aroma": "The nose opens with vibrant notes of raspberry and cherry, layered with aromatic herbs and dark chocolate. Subtle tobacco leaf and hints of pencil shavings emerge as the wine breathes, revealing the complexity of 2017's growing season. Underlying mineral notes speak to the volcanic soils of Walla Walla Valley.",
        "palate": "On the palate, ripe cherry and blackberry flavors are framed by well-integrated oak. The mid-palate shows excellent weight with flavors of dark chocolate, dried herbs, and a touch of espresso. Ripe, polished tannins provide structure without heaviness, while bright acidity maintains balance and freshness throughout.",
        "finish": "The finish is long and harmonious, with lingering notes of dark fruit, subtle baking spices, and a whisper of cedar. The tannins remain supple and refined, inviting contemplation and suggesting excellent aging potential for 5-10 years."
