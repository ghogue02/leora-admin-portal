      "productName": "Priorat Trossos Abracadabra 2022",
      "description": "An expressive red wine from Spain's legendary Priorat region, where ancient vines grow in dramatic slate and quartzite llicorella soils. Trossos represents a modern interpretation of Priorat's traditional blends, balancing power with elegance and showcasing the unique minerality that makes this region one of Spain's most prestigious appellations.",
      "tastingNotes": {
        "aroma": "Intensely aromatic with layers of ripe blackberry, black plum, and dark cherry, interwoven with garrigue herbs including lavender, rosemary, and wild thyme. The distinctive mineral character of llicorella slate emerges as graphite and crushed stone, while notes of violet, licorice, and dark cocoa add complexity. Subtle oak influence provides hints of vanilla, cedar, and sweet tobacco, integrated seamlessly with the concentrated fruit. The aromatic profile speaks to the region's unique terroir and Mediterranean climate.",
        "palate": "Full-bodied and concentrated with remarkable depth and structure, the palate delivers intense flavors of blackberry compote, cassis, and dark plum, supported by fine-grained tannins and balanced acidity. The llicorella soils impart a distinctive mineral quality that runs through the wine like a backbone, adding precision to the generous fruit. Mid-palate complexity reveals layers of black olive, dried fig, espresso, and bitter chocolate, while Mediterranean herb notes of oregano and sage add savory dimension. Despite the wine's power, it maintains remarkable elegance and balance.",
        "finish": "The finish is long, powerful, and intensely mineral, with persistent dark fruit flavors gradually giving way to slate, graphite, and earthy notes. Fine tannins provide structure that suggests excellent aging potential, while the mineral backbone ensures the wine doesn't feel heavy despite its concentration. Lingering notes of dark chocolate, espresso, and dried herbs provide complexity, ending with the distinctive salty-mineral quality that defines great Priorat."
