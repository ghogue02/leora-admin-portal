      "description": "A svelte and contemplative Chenin Blanc from old bush vines rooted in decomposed granitic soils of the Bottelary Hills, Stellenbosch. The dry land vines, planted in the early 1980s with epic vistas of Table Mountain, weathered the tempestuous 2016 vintage to produce small clusters of intensely concentrated fruit. Barrel fermented and matured in old French oak, this wine is intentionally Loire-like in style and benefits greatly from bottle maturation.",
      "tastingNotes": {
        "aroma": "The nose is delicate and nuanced, opening with a combination of citrus blossom and yellow fruits—golden apple and ripe pear. Green apple and red pear notes add freshness, while subtle hints of toasted almond and gentle ginger provide complexity. Distinctive aromas of honey, rooibos tea, and a tell-tale chalky minerality emerge, adding layers of interest to this contemplative, shy expression of Chenin Blanc.",
        "palate": "Svelte and medium-bodied with a lovely pithy texture, the palate reveals flavors of green apple, golden apple, and yellow fruits, balanced by bright acidity. Subtle notes of toasted almond, honey, and rooibos tea add richness without heaviness, while a distinctive chalky, mineral texture reinforces the wine's terroir-driven character. The wine's old-vine concentration and barrel fermentation contribute to its complex, layered profile, while restraint and elegance define the overall impression.",
        "finish": "The finish is long and mineral-driven, characterized by a tell-tale chalky texture and bright acidity. Lingering flavors of citrus blossom, yellow fruits, and toasted almond persist, while the wine's Loire-like structure ensures a clean, refreshing conclusion."
