        "aroma": "The nose presents evolved aromas of baked apple, poached pear, and honeyed apricot, layered with notes of toasted hazelnut, butterscotch, and crème brûlée from oak aging. Tertiary development brings hints of dried flowers, chamomile, and beeswax. A subtle mineral quality and wet stone character add complexity, while restrained oxidative notes suggest careful cellaring. The aromatic profile shows the wine's maturity while maintaining freshness and elegance.",
        "palate": "Medium-bodied with creamy texture and well-integrated acidity. Flavors of baked orchard fruit, lemon curd, and toasted almond dominate, complemented by notes of vanilla, caramel, and subtle oak spice. The wine shows excellent development with oxidative characteristics adding complexity—think white mushroom, salted butter, and brioche. Hungarian Chardonnays typically retain higher acidity than warmer climate examples, and this wine's bright acid backbone keeps it balanced despite its age. A distinctive mineral quality and saline finish reflect the terroir.",
        "finish": "Long and contemplative, with lingering flavors of toasted nuts, honeyed fruit, and subtle oak. The acidity provides lift and structure, while a mineral quality and gentle phenolic grip add complexity. The finish shows the wine's maturity and integration, with all elements in harmony."
