        "aroma": "Pale yellow with greenish hues, clean and bright in appearance. The nose displays large aromatic intensity focused on citrus and white fruits. Meyer lemon, lime, and grapefruit provide the citrus backbone, while white peach, green apple, and pear contribute orchard fruit character. Sweet, plummy notes add unexpected richness, while balsamic touches of fresh herbs—basil, fennel—provide Mediterranean complexity. The aromatic profile is both vibrant and layered.",
        "palate": "Very fresh and beautifully balanced on the palate, this wine showcases the distinctive creamy texture found in Pansa Blanca wines from Alella. White fruit flavors of apple and pear dominate, supported by citrus zest and a characteristic mineral edge. The notable freshness is perfectly balanced with the alcoholic content and minimal residual sugar, creating harmony. Good acidity provides structure and length, while the four months of aging in stainless steel preserves purity. Medium-bodied with exceptional drinkability.",
        "finish": "Intense finish for a medium-bodied wine, with white fruit and citrus notes persisting. The characteristic Pansa Blanca texture extends through the aftertaste—slightly creamy yet fresh. Mineral notes and good acidity linger, leaving a clean and refreshing impression that invites food pairing."
