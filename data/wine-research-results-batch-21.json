      "tastingNotes": {
        "aroma": "The bouquet opens with intriguing notes of brioche and subtle yeast character, reflecting the wine's tank aging on lees, which adds complexity beyond typical Sauvignon Blanc. Bright citrus aromas of lemon and grapefruit emerge alongside white fruit notes of pear and white peach. A distinctive touch of bonbon arlequin (mixed fruit candy) adds a playful element to the aromatic profile, while subtle mineral and grassy notes typical of Loire Sauvignon Blanc provide freshness.",
        "palate": "On the palate, this wine shows good expression with notable roundness and slight sweetness that distinguishes it from the razor-sharp acidity of Sancerre. The tank aging contributes to a fuller mouthfeel with subtle creaminess, while flavors of citrus fruits—particularly lemon and lime—blend with white orchard fruits and tropical notes. The wine maintains refreshing acidity balanced by its inherent roundness, creating an approachable yet characterful style. The subtle sweetness referenced in professional notes is gentle and well-integrated, adding to the wine's appeal without making it cloying.",
        "finish": "The finish offers good length with lingering citrus and white fruit flavors, complemented by those distinctive brioche notes from lees contact. The slight sweetness persists gently on the aftertaste, balanced by refreshing acidity that keeps the palate interested and engaged."
