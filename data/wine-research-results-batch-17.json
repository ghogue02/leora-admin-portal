      "description": "A premium barrel-fermented white wine from one of Rioja's most historic bodegas, Monte Real. This wine represents the modern evolution of white Rioja, combining indigenous varietals with sophisticated barrel fermentation techniques to create a wine of depth, complexity, and exceptional aging potential.",
      "tastingNotes": {
        "aroma": "Complex aromatics showcase ripe stone fruit including white peach, apricot, and nectarine, layered with barrel fermentation notes of vanilla bean, toasted hazelnut, and brioche. The nose reveals elegant oak integration with hints of crème brûlée, butter, and light toast complementing rather than dominating the fruit. Underlying notes of citrus blossom, chamomile, and wet stone add freshness and minerality. A subtle oxidative character typical of barrel-fermented whites contributes complexity with hints of baked apple and honey.",
        "palate": "Full-bodied and richly textured with creamy lees influence and barrel fermentation adding weight and complexity. The palate delivers flavors of ripe golden apple, poached pear, and tropical notes of mango and pineapple, balanced by vibrant acidity that prevents heaviness. Oak influence is pronounced but harmonious, contributing vanilla, butterscotch, and sweet spice notes alongside a subtle smoky quality. The wine shows excellent structure with a slightly phenolic grip and mineral backbone that adds dimension. Lees aging provides a silky, almost glycerin-like texture.",
        "finish": "The finish is long, complex, and satisfying, with oak spice, stone fruit, and mineral notes extending gracefully. Hints of toasted almond, vanilla, and a subtle oxidative character linger alongside refreshing acidity, creating a complete and sophisticated conclusion."
