        "palate": "Full-bodied for a white wine, the palate balances richness with refreshing acidity that keeps the wine lively and bright. Flavors of crisp apple and citrus fruit dominate, supported by notes of ripe pear and subtle stone fruit complexity. The wine's relatively high acidity provides structure and ensures food compatibility, while a creamy mid-palate texture suggests sur lie aging or partial barrel fermentation. The overall impression is one of balance between fruit purity, textural interest, and crisp freshness that makes Pinot Blanc so versatile at the table.",
        "finish": "The finish is clean and moderately long, with lingering apple and citrus notes accompanied by subtle minerality. The wine's bright acidity leaves the palate refreshed while gentle creaminess provides satisfaction, creating a harmonious conclusion that invites food pairing."
