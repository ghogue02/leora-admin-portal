Red and dark fruit aromas of raspberry, blackberry, and plum interweave with violet florals and subtle herbal notes of fynbos and dried sage. Spice elements of white pepper, cardamom, and a hint of clove add intrigue, while underlying notes of graphite, cedar, and earthy minerals speak to the wine's complexity and terroir expression. A whisper of game and leather suggests early development.",
        "palate": "On the palate, this field blend delivers remarkable complexity and harmony, with the co-fermented varieties creating a seamless, integrated whole. Medium to full-bodied, the wine shows layers of red and black fruit—cherry, blackcurrant, and wild strawberry—supported by excellent structural elements. Firm but refined tannins provide backbone, while fresh acidity keeps everything balanced and lively. The diversity of varieties contributes a fascinating array of flavors: dark chocolate, espresso, dried herbs, black olive, and a distinctive savory quality that makes the wine incredibly food-friendly. A subtle mineral thread runs through the palate, adding texture and length.",
        "finish": "The finish is long and layered with persistent dark fruit, spice, and earthy notes. The wine's complexity reveals itself fully on the finish, with each sip uncovering new nuances of fruit, herb, mineral, and spice that linger impressively."
