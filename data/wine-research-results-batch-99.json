A touch of spice - black pepper and clove - emerges with aeration, along with delicate floral notes that speak to the wine's freshness and biodynamic farming.",
        "palate": "On the palate, this blend of Carignan, Syrah, Mourvèdre, and Grenache shows remarkable balance and refreshing lightness of touch. The wine delivers concentrated dark fruit flavors - cassis, blackberry, and dark plum - supported by fine, integrated tannins that provide structure without heaviness. The wide temperature variations from day to night during the growing season have encouraged slow, progressive growth, resulting in a wine with excellent freshness and aromatic complexity. Mid-palate flavors reveal hints of dried herbs, black olive tapenade, and a subtle mineral edge. The texture is silky and refined, showing the benefits of organic and biodynamic viticulture.",
        "finish": "The finish is long and harmonious with persistent dark fruit and herbal notes. Fine tannins provide gentle grip, while the wine's refreshing acidity keeps it lively and food-friendly. A subtle mineral edge adds definition to the satisfying conclusion."
