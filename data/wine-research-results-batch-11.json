      "productName": "Shabo Grande Reserve Cabernet Sauvignon 2023",
      "description": "A flagship expression from Ukraine's historic Shabo estate, representing 200 years of winemaking heritage in the Odessa region. This Grande Reserve Cabernet Sauvignon showcases the potential of Ukraine's Black Sea coastal climate to produce structured, age-worthy wines from international varieties. The 2023 vintage captures the variety's classic character while expressing the unique terroir of the region's continental climate and limestone-rich soils.",
      "tastingNotes": {
        "aroma": "Classic and compelling aromatics of Cabernet Sauvignon with pronounced blackcurrant, cassis, and black cherry forming the core. The nose reveals additional layers of dark plum, blueberry, and blackberry alongside distinctive varietal notes of green bell pepper (pyrazine), eucalyptus, and mint that add complexity without dominating. The Grande Reserve oak treatment contributes aromas of vanilla bean, cedar chest, and tobacco leaf, while the Odessa terroir adds subtle mineral nuances of graphite and wet gravel. With aeration, notes of violet, dark chocolate, and a hint of coffee bean emerge alongside the Black Sea influence of subtle saline minerality.",
        "palate": "Full-bodied and structured with firm, youthful tannins that promise excellent aging potential. The palate delivers concentrated flavors of blackcurrant, black cherry, and cassis with additional notes of dark plum, mulberry, and boysenberry. Mid-palate depth reveals layers of dark chocolate, espresso, and black olive alongside the variety's characteristic herbal elements of dried sage and tobacco. Well-integrated oak contributes vanilla, cedar, and sweet spice notes of cinnamon and clove without overwhelming the fruit. The wine shows excellent balance between ripe fruit concentration, structured tannins, and refreshing acidity that provides lift and aging potential. Subtle mineral notes and a hint of leather add complexity to this young, powerful Cabernet.",
        "finish": "Long and structured with persistent dark fruit flavors, firm tannins, and lingering notes of cedar, graphite, and dark chocolate. The finish shows the wine's youth with grippy tannins that will soften with age, leaving impressions of cassis, espresso, and subtle spice that invite cellaring."
