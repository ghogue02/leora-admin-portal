Aromas of plum and very ripe wild berries lead the way, complemented by notes of rockrose and macerated red fruits. Subtle fragrances reminiscent of high-quality grape marc add complexity, while delicate floral notes - particularly violets - provide elegance. Hints of black cherry, blackberry, and blueberry create a ripe, inviting bouquet with well-marked acidity keeping everything lifted.",
        "palate": "The wine shows strong structure that is dense and concentrated, yet maintains elegance and smoothness. Flavors of ripe red fruits - blueberries, black cherries, and blackberries - dominate, with subtle floral fragrances adding complexity. The tannins are soft, well-incorporated, and firm but fruity, providing framework without astringency. The texture is creamy and well-structured with fantastic acidity that keeps the wine fresh and vibrant. Despite its concentration, the wine remains balanced and food-friendly, showing the best of what Vinho Verde reds can achieve.",
        "finish": "The finish is long and elegant with persistent red fruit flavors. Soft, integrated tannins provide gentle grip, while the wine's vibrant acidity leaves the palate refreshed and ready for another sip."
