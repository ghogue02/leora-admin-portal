    "productName": "Philippe Guerin Melon de Bourgogne Orange 2021",
    "description": "An innovative orange wine from Loire Valley producer Philippe Guerin, made from the Melon de Bourgogne grape typically used for Muscadet. Orange wine production involves extended skin contact with white grapes, creating amber-hued wines with added structure and complexity. This represents a modern, natural winemaking approach applied to a traditional Loire variety.",
    "tastingNotes": {
      "aroma": "The nose is complex and unconventional, showcasing orange wine's distinctive character. Aromas of dried apricot, orange peel, and apple skin lead, complemented by notes of chamomile tea, saffron, and honey. There's pronounced phenolic character showing as walnut skin, tea leaves, and hay. Subtle oxidative notes of bruised apple and quince add intrigue, while hints of sourdough bread and lees suggest natural fermentation. A touch of coastal minerality and saline persists underneath.",
      "palate": "Medium to full-bodied with substantial texture and grip from extended skin contact. Flavors of dried stone fruits, orange rind, and apple skin dominate, supported by pronounced tannins unusual in white wine. The wine shows beautiful savory complexity with notes of dried herbs, tea, nuts, and spice. Refreshing acidity cuts through the textural weight, while a distinctive saline minerality adds depth. The phenolic structure gives the wine a slightly astringent, grippy quality that demands food. There's fascinating complexity between fruit, tannin, acidity, and mineral elements.",
      "finish": "The finish is long and textured, with lingering dried fruit, tea tannins, and saline minerality. The wine leaves a pleasant, slightly drying sensation that calls for another sip and food pairing."
