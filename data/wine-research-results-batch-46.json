Notes of white flowers, lemon verbena, and honeydew melon add delicate complexity, while hints of wet stone and chalk provide mineral interest. Without oak influence, the aromatics are crisp and focused, showcasing pure varietal character with touches of grapefruit and subtle tropical fruit nuances.",

The palate delivers flavors of Granny Smith apple, Asian pear, and white peach, complemented by bright citrus notes of lime and lemon.

The wine's crisp, unadulterated character provides excellent drinkability with a fresh, mouth-watering quality throughout.",
