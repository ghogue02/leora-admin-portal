        "finish": "The finish is persistent and refined with lingering red fruit flavors and a gentle grip of fine-grained tannins. A savory quality of dried herbs and umami richness appears in the conclusion, while the wine's natural acidity keeps everything fresh and balanced. The coastal terroir signature of mineral salinity extends through the finish, leaving a clean, elegant impression."

      "productName": "Domaine Chevallier Chablis 2022",
      "description": "Domaine Chevallier's Chablis exemplifies the pure, mineral-driven expression of Chardonnay that has made this northern Burgundy appellation world-renowned. The 2022 vintage captures Chablis' signature steely character, with the region's ancient Kimmeridgian limestone soils imparting distinctive chalky minerality and razor-sharp precision to unoaked or lightly oaked Chardonnay.",
      "tastingNotes": {
        "aroma": "The nose is characteristically restrained yet complex, opening with aromas of green apple, fresh lemon, and white peach alongside pronounced mineral notes of wet stones, crushed oyster shell, and chalk dust that define classic Chablis. Delicate floral hints of white flowers and acacia blossom add elegance, while subtle notes of fresh herbs, lemon verbena, and a whisper of honeycomb speak to the wine's complexity. The maritime influence of Chablis' northerly location is evident in the wine's saline quality and bracing freshness.",
        "palate": "The palate is taut, focused, and intensely mineral-driven with flavors of Granny Smith apple, Meyer lemon, and unripe pear balanced by Chablis' signature flinty minerality. Razor-sharp acidity provides structure and energy, cutting through with precision while showcasing the 2022 vintage's freshness and tension. The wine shows medium body with excellent phenolic texture—a slightly chalky, almost saline mouthfeel that adds dimension beyond simple fruit. Subtle notes of wet stone, iodine, and sea spray reinforce the terroir-driven character.",
        "finish": "The finish is long, clean, and mineral-focused with persistent citrus notes and a pronounced saline quality that leaves the mouth watering. The wine's high acidity ensures a refreshing conclusion, while the distinctive chalk and limestone minerality lingers impressively, inviting contemplation and food pairing."
