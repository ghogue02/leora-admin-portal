Flavors of ripe boysenberry, black cherry, and cassis dominate, supported by secondary notes of dark cocoa, licorice, and baking spices.

Mid-palate richness reveals layers of mocha, black tea, and a mineral backbone that speaks to old-vine intensity.",

      "description": "An elegant Argentine red blend from Mendoza's high-altitude vineyards, this Rapsodia bottling represents the sophisticated evolution of Argentine winemaking beyond single-varietal Malbec. The wine showcases the complexity achievable through careful blending and extended aging, offering a harmonious expression of Mendoza's diverse terroir and winemaking artistry.",
      "tastingNotes": {
        "aroma": "The mature bouquet opens with evolved aromas of dried cherry, plum compote, and blackberry preserves, layered with notes of leather, tobacco leaf, and cedar box. Secondary aromas of vanilla, mocha, and dark chocolate from oak aging are well-integrated, while tertiary notes of dried herbs, eucalyptus, and forest floor add complexity. With air, hints of fig, prune, and a distinctive mineral quality characteristic of high-altitude Mendoza fruit emerge.",
        "palate": "Medium to full-bodied with softened, integrated tannins that speak to bottle age, the palate delivers flavors of dark cherry, blackberry, and plum complemented by notes of espresso, dark chocolate, and sweet spice. The wine shows excellent evolution, with primary fruit giving way to complex secondary and tertiary flavors of leather, cigar box, dried fruit, and earthy minerality. Balanced acidity provides freshness despite the wine's maturity, while a silky texture reflects gentle aging. Mid-palate richness reveals layers of cocoa, black tea, anise, and a distinctive graphite note.",
        "finish": "The finish is long and sophisticated, with well-integrated tannins supporting persistent flavors of dark fruit, tobacco, and exotic spices. Lingering notes of dark chocolate, espresso, and dried herbs fade gracefully, while subtle oak influence adds vanilla and cedar nuances. The wine's mature complexity and elegant structure showcase the rewards of patience with quality Argentine reds."
