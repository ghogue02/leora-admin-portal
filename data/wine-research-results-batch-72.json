      "productName": "Black Elephant Vintners Three Men in a Tub with a Rubber Duck Blend 2024",
      "description": "A playful yet serious red blend from South Africa's self-proclaimed 'Rebels of the Vine,' Black Elephant Vintners. Crafted by winemaker Kevin Swart, viticulturist Raymond Ndlovu, and Jacques Wentzel from coastal region vineyards, this wine pushes boundaries of traditional winemaking while delivering exceptional quality and value.",
      "tastingNotes": {
        "aroma": "Rich and peppery on the nose, the wine opens with concentrated aromas of dark cherries and ripe plums. Sweet spice notes of black pepper and liquorice add complexity, while the bouquet shows a fruit-driven intensity that's inviting and generous. Subtle hints from extended oak aging provide depth without dominating the expressive fruit character.",
        "palate": "The palate is beautifully balanced, delivering sweet cherry and plum fruit accented by distinctive pepper and liquorice flavors. Extended oak aging—19 months in French barrels for the 2020 vintage—adds structure and has softened the tannins to a supple, velvety texture. The wine shows the power expected from Cabernet Sauvignon blended with the roundness of Merlot and the spicy complexity of Shiraz or Mourvèdre (depending on vintage). Fruit-forward yet structured, it offers both immediate pleasure and underlying complexity.",
        "finish": "The finish is long with a distinctive spicy note, showing lingering flavors of dark fruit, pepper, and liquorice. Well-integrated tannins provide grip and length without astringency, while the oak influence adds subtle vanilla and toast notes to the conclusion."
