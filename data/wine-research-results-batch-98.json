        "aroma": "The nose bursts with vibrant aromatics of citrus and orchard fruit, led by bright notes of Meyer lemon, pink grapefruit zest, and crisp green apple. There's a beautiful floral quality featuring white flowers, acacia blossoms, and delicate honeysuckle that adds elegance to the aromatic profile. Subtle mineral notes reminiscent of wet stone and chalk emerge, reflecting the wine's terroir, while hints of fresh herbs including lemon verbena and mint provide additional complexity.",
        "palate": "Medium-bodied with a refreshing, crisp mouthfeel driven by vibrant acidity that energizes the palate. Flavors of citrus dominate, featuring lemon curd, grapefruit, and lime zest, complemented by green apple and white peach notes. There's a pleasant mineral edge that runs through the wine, adding structure and depth to the fruit core. The wine shows excellent balance between fruit expression and acidity, maintaining freshness while delivering satisfying flavor intensity. A subtle salinity emerges on the mid-palate, enhancing the wine's food-friendly character.",
        "finish": "The finish is clean and persistent, with lingering citrus notes and that distinctive subtle mineral quality that defines quality Pecorino. Refreshing acidity leaves the palate cleansed and invigorated, with hints of white flowers and herbs remaining as the wine fades. The wine's energy and vibrancy shine through to the very end."
