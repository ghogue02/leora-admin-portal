The wine's dry style (brut) is balanced and sophisticated, with a mineral backbone that adds length. The texture is refined and elegant, with beautifully integrated effervescence.",
        "finish": "The finish is clean and refreshing, with lingering red berry fruit, subtle toast, and delicate mineral notes. Fine bubbles continue to dance on the palate, providing a lively, celebratory conclusion that invites another sip."
