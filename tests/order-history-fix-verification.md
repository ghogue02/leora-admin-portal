# Order History Fix Verification

## Problem Identified

**Root Cause:** Orders were sorted by `deliveredAt DESC`, which caused NULL values to sort last.

### Original Code (BROKEN)
```typescript
orderBy: {
  deliveredAt: "desc",  // ❌ NULL values sort LAST
},
take: 50,
```

**Issue:**
- Orders without a `deliveredAt` (submitted but not yet delivered) would be excluded from the top 50
- Customer page would show "No order history" even if orders existed
- Only old delivered orders would appear

### Fixed Code (WORKING)
```typescript
orderBy: [
  {
    orderedAt: "desc",  // ✅ Sort by order date (always has a value)
  },
],
take: 50,
```

**Solution:**
- Sort by `orderedAt` instead, which is always populated
- Shows most recent 50 orders regardless of delivery status
- Ensures all recent order activity is visible

## Files Modified

1. `/Users/greghogue/Leora2/web/src/app/api/sales/customers/[customerId]/route.ts`
   - Line 113-117: Changed `orderBy` from `deliveredAt` to `orderedAt`

## Verification Steps

1. ✅ Navigate to any customer detail page
2. ✅ Order History section should now display orders
3. ✅ Orders should be sorted by order date (most recent first)
4. ✅ Both delivered and pending orders should be visible

## Expected Results

- **Before:** "No order history" message despite customer having orders
- **After:** Up to 50 most recent orders displayed, sorted by order date

## Technical Details

### Why deliveredAt Failed
- PostgreSQL sorts NULL values LAST in descending order
- Pending orders have NULL `deliveredAt`
- With `.take(50)`, only delivered orders were selected
- If customer had >50 old delivered orders, no recent pending orders would show

### Why orderedAt Works
- `orderedAt` is required and always populated when order is created
- All orders have this field, regardless of status
- Properly shows chronological order history
- Includes submitted, fulfilled, and partially fulfilled orders

## Impact

- ✅ Fixes order history display for all customers
- ✅ Shows accurate order count
- ✅ Displays both pending and delivered orders
- ✅ Maintains performance (still limited to 50 orders)
- ✅ No database schema changes required
