## 💡 CRITICAL DECISION POINT

You have **two excellent paths forward**:

### Path A: Deploy with Priority 1 Fixes (2-3 hours) ⭐ **HIGHLY RECOMMENDED**

**What You Do**:
1. Integrate the 5 Priority 1 components I created (2 hours)
2. Quick test with frontend agent
3. Deploy to production

**What Travis's Team Gets**:
- Fully functional order system
- Professional customer selection
- Visual calendar
- Clear inventory status
- Helpful error messages
- All critical pain points resolved

**Why This is Best**:
- Resolves all **blocking** UX issues
