## What is Sample Management?

The Sample Management system helps you track wine/spirit samples given to customers, record their feedback, and monitor which samples convert to orders. You have a monthly budget of 60 samples (configurable by your manager).

## How to Access

2. Click **"Samples"** in the top navigation bar
3. You'll see your budget tracker and usage history

## Test 1: View Your Budget

**What you'll see:**
- Current month (e.g., "October 2025")
- Samples used vs. allowance (e.g., "15 of 60 samples used")

- Remaining samples count

**What to check:**
- ‚úÖ Numbers make sense based on your usage

## Common Issues & Solutions

### Modal won't load customers/products
- **Cause:** No customers assigned to you or no active SKUs
- **Solution:** Contact your manager to assign customers or activate products

### "Customer not found or not assigned to you" error
- **Cause:** Trying to log sample for unassigned customer
- **Solution:** Only select customers from the dropdown (they're pre-filtered to your territory)

### Budget shows wrong count
- **Cause:** Samples logged outside current month
- **Solution:** Budget only counts current month. Old samples don't affect this month's budget.

### Can't see navigation link
- **Cause:** Not logged in as sales rep
- **Solution:** Make sure you have a sales rep profile and are using `/sales/login` (not portal login)
