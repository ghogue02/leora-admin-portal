# Automated Wine Enrichment Process

## Current Status
- ✅ **Completed:** Batches 1-11 (58 wines, 3.1%)
- 🔄 **In Progress:** Batches 12-16 (5 agents running)
- ⏳ **Remaining:** Batches 17-188 (177 batches, ~1,770 wines)

## Strategy for Remaining 177 Batches

### Parallel Processing (Recommended)

**Run in waves of 5 agents:**
- Wave 1-2: ✅ Complete (batches 2-11)
- Wave 3: 🔄 Running (batches 12-16)
- Wave 4-40: ⏳ Remaining (batches 17-188)

**Total waves needed:** 38 waves × 5 agents = 190 agent runs

### Execution Pattern

For each wave, spawn 5 researcher agents in a single message:

```typescript
[Single Message]:
  Task("Researcher 1", "Research batch N...", "researcher")
  Task("Researcher 2", "Research batch N+1...", "researcher")
  Task("Researcher 3", "Research batch N+2...", "researcher")
  Task("Researcher 4", "Research batch N+3...", "researcher")
  Task("Researcher 5", "Research batch N+4...", "researcher")
```

Then apply results:
```bash
for i in N N+1 N+2 N+3 N+4; do
  npx tsx scripts/apply-enrichment-results.ts $i
done
```

### Time Estimates

**Per Wave:**
- 5 agents × 10 wines × ~3 min = ~30 min parallel
- Apply results: ~2 min
- **Total per wave: ~32 minutes**

**Remaining:**
- 38 waves × 32 min = **~20 hours**
- With dedicated focus: 2-3 days
- With breaks/monitoring: 4-5 days

## Quick Commands

### Check Progress
```bash
npx tsx scripts/monitor-enrichment-progress.ts
```

### Apply Multiple Batches
```bash
# Apply batches 12-16
for i in {12..16}; do npx tsx scripts/apply-enrichment-results.ts $i; done

# Apply batches 17-21
for i in {17..21}; do npx tsx scripts/apply-enrichment-results.ts $i; done
```

### Verify Uniqueness
```bash
npx tsx scripts/check-unique-notes.ts
```

## Next Waves (Copy/Paste Ready)

### Wave 4: Batches 17-21
```
Task("Researcher", "Research batch 17", "researcher")
Task("Researcher", "Research batch 18", "researcher")
Task("Researcher", "Research batch 19", "researcher")
Task("Researcher", "Research batch 20", "researcher")
Task("Researcher", "Research batch 21", "researcher")
```

### Wave 5: Batches 22-26
```
Task("Researcher", "Research batch 22", "researcher")
Task("Researcher", "Research batch 23", "researcher")
Task("Researcher", "Research batch 24", "researcher")
Task("Researcher", "Research batch 25", "researcher")
Task("Researcher", "Research batch 26", "researcher")
```

## Automation Option

For fully automated processing, you can continue the pattern:
1. Spawn 5 agents
2. Wait ~30 min
3. Apply results
4. Check progress
5. Repeat for next 5 batches

The system is designed to handle this efficiently with Claude Code's parallel agent execution!

## Success Metrics

Target by completion:
- ✅ 1,850+ wines enriched (98%+)
- ✅ Average confidence: 80%+
- ✅ Zero duplicate tasting notes
- ✅ All wines have unique, accurate descriptions
